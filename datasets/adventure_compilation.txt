You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter
the pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky
mutter ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of
Anchorhead.

Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to
happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer
claiming to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family,
was bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of
planning and decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing
up and shipping away of your entire home, your entire life...

Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight,
over a thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting
ready to move into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far
removed that not even Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only
been married since June and none of this was any of your idea in the first
place, and already it's starting to rain.

These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.

You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head,
trying to focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate
agent and pick up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town
to take care of some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up
in a few minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious
process of settling in.

A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down
harder -- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones.
Shouldn't it be snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh,
you open your umbrella.

Welcome to Anchorhead...

[                 * THE FIRST DAY *

I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern
sea was upon me.

It seems to be locked.

>x door
The door has a glass front with the name of the real estate company -- Benson &
Brackhurst -- stenciled across it. The blinds are drawn, the lights are off
inside, and no one appears to be home. Odd, since the agent knew you were coming
today.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting
on the wind.

Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

>n
You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.

Local Pub
A dank, drafty old drinking hole lit by flickering, oil-burning lanterns. Smoke
collects in greasy pools among the rafters, and shadows crowd thick around. The
bar runs the length of the room to your right, while to the south a low doorway
opens onto the street.

Mill workers and fishermen occupy a few of the tables, drinking beer or puffing
grimly at long-stemmed pipes. Each is wrapped in his solitude, soaking up the
general miasma of dreary fatalism.

The lantern sitting on the table nearest you sputters fitfully, throwing
distorted shadows across the wall.

>get lantern
No one here looks as though they'd mind if you borrowed one of these lamps.
Casually, you purloin the nearest one.

>x lantern
It's an old-fashioned hurricane lamp, with a tall glass chimney to protect it
from the wind. The cotton wick burns fitfully in its reservoir of cheap oil.

>x self
You look good, considering. A bit rattled by recent events, perhaps, but well-
poised and collected, all the same.

>inventory
You are wearing your wedding ring, your trenchcoat and your clothes; in
addition, you have in your hands a lantern (providing light) and your umbrella.

The pockets of your trenchcoat are empty.

>put lantern in coat
It wouldn't be very wise to put the lantern in your pocket while it's still
burning.

>turn off lantern
That's not something you can switch.

>unlight lantern
That's not a verb I recognise.

>x table
It's just an ordinary-looking table.

>x bar
A dark and dour expanse of wood, pitted and scarred and stained with the rings
from over a hundred years' worth of slopping beer mugs.

>x workers
The patrons of this place are taciturn and grim. No one speaks. No one looks
anyone in the eye. No one, in fact, even looks up from his beer. A heavy aura of
resignation -- and, it almost seems, dread -- hangs palpably over the whole
crowd.

>s
As you make your way to the door, your foot strikes something under one of the
tables.

>look under table
Some forgetful soul has left a flask underneath one of the tables, pushed into a
shadowy corner.

>get flask
You pick up the flask. The label is faded and mostly peeled away, but what
little you can make out seems to indicate that this is not a particularly
distinguished brand of spirits. The words "bootleg" and "rotgut" come to mind,
probably because they are the only words legible on what's left of the label.

>put flask in coat
You slip the flask into the pocket of your trenchcoat.

>s
The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.

Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

A sudden gust of rain puts the lantern out.

>w

Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a
country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the
east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make
out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

>nw

University Court
Isolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University
represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural
achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and
enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further
into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for
its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most
extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer
Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage
and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they
take care of their own.

There are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one
you are interested in is the library to the west, where Michael told you he'd be
until he came back to the real estate agent's office to pick you up. Which,
incidentally, he has not yet done.

>w
You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.

Library
Shadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps
cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior.
You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a
welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a
small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.

Peering through the shadows, you spot your husband sitting at one of the reading
desks, absorbed in some sort of weighty tome and clearly oblivious to the time.

>x lamps
The lamps have curved, brass stands and frosted green shades; the kind of thing
you'd expect to see on an accountant's desk in the 1930s.

The reading lamp is currently switched on.

>x husband
Tall and a bit on the skinny side, in an endearingly awkward sort of way; a
serious, thoughtful face topped with an unruly tangle of brown hair; deep brown
eyes framed by wire-rimmed glasses -- yep, that's the man you married, all
right.

At the moment, Michael is largely absorbed in his reading, and is paying little
attention to you.

Michael looks up, startled, then realizes it's you and smiles. "Hi, hon," he
says, closing the book and stretching. Then he glances at his watch. "Good
grief, what happened to the time? I'm so sorry -- I just lost track." He smiles
sheepishly.

"Well?" he asks. "Did you get the keys?"

>ask michael about keys
"The real estate agent is supposed to be holding them at her office," he says.

>ask michael about agent
He frowns as you tell him about the real estate agent's disappearance. "That is
rather odd," he says. "I wonder where she could be?"

>save
Ok.

>ask michael about help
You can't think of anything to say about that for the moment.

>examine book
Michael jerks the book away from you. "Excuse me," he says, a bit more sharply
than you had expected, "I'll be done with it in a minute."

>examine book
It's obvious Michael is trying to hide something from you, and while you very
much want to know what in the world it is, it would be best not to make a scene
about it here.

>ask michael about keys
"The real estate agent is supposed to be holding them at her office," he says.

Circulation Desk
A high counter divides the public portion of the library from the reserved
stacks -- all the more esoteric and mysterious volumes from the university's
collection. If anything, the area behind the counter is even more shadowy than
the side you're on. The main reading area lies south.

Hanging on the wall next to the counter is a small, printed sign. Beneath the
sign sits a heavy, dog-eared register, and sitting next to the register is a
bell.

>read sign
"All restricted books must be signed for on the register, and may not be removed
from this building. Please have your faculty ID ready when you make your
request."

>read register
It's basically a log, recording what book was checked out, who checked it out,
and when. There must be hundreds of names here.

>ring bell

Ding.

A moment later, the gaunt and fishy-eyed librarian emerges silently from the
shadows behind the counter.

>x librarian
Her slack, pallid skin looks as if it has seen little more than the inside of a
cave for most of her life. She stares at you silently with disturbingly large
and watery eyes.

>ask librarian for help
The librarian purses her thin, fishy lips at you. Apparently, she only lends out
library books.

>s
Without a word, the librarian fades back into the shadows.

Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office,
which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the
west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

>se

Alley
This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of
rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick
walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a
tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style
window.

>x window
It's about eighteen inches wide and a foot tall, with hinges along the top that
allow it to swing out. It's currently closed.

>open window
The window is too high.

>x fence
One of the boards seems to be loose down at the bottom; you could probably just
squeeze through.

>go under fence
(closing the umbrella first)
Dropping to your hands and knees, you wriggle underneath the loose board and
scramble down a muddy slope.

Narrow Beach
This narrow strip of beach is tucked away between two outcroppings in the
predominantly rocky shoreline, accessible only from a steep, muddy slope to the
west. The sand is filthy and strewn with rocks, seaweed, litter and other bits
of storm-tossed detritus.

Near the bottom of the slope, a sewage outflow pipe juts out over the beach,
about three feet above the ground. A thin stream of acrid-smelling sewer water
trickles out over the lip of the pipe, forming a puddle in the sand.

You are getting wet.

>up
You pick your way up the slope, push the loose board aside and slip back in
through the gap.

Grunting and holding your breath, you manhandle one of the filthy cans under the
window.

>stand on can
You clamber onto the wobbling garbage can, precariously balanced. You can just
reach the lower edge of the window from here.

>open window
You open the transom window.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting
on the wind.

>enter window
(closing the umbrella first)
It's a tight squeeze, but you just manage to wriggle through, dropping quietly
to the floor inside.

File Room
Peering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing
cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the
south wall lets in a very faint illumination.

>x cabinets
There must be hundreds of files here, too many to browse through. You'll have to
look up something specific if you want to find anything.

>w

Office
Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted,
papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and
the file room lies east.

Sitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering
machine.

Someone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.

>x answering machine
A simple answering machine, with a small display indicating messages received, a
button labeled "PLAY", and a button labeled "DELETE".

>push play
For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls
of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where
the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible
through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a
single word:

"Verlac."

The machine beeps.

A brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, "Verlac" is the name of
this branch of Michael's family.

>e

File Room
Peering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing
cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the

Strange; the file on the Verlac property has been cleaned out. Title, deed, all
the papers, all of it gone. There is, however, a set of keys tucked down in the
hanging folder. You quickly pocket them.

Twisting Lane
The lane narrows here to little more than a badly cobbled sidewalk as it wends
its way up through a series of tortuous bends and switchbacks. In some places,
the street is so steep that steps have been cut into it, worn down over the
years and slick with moss. Your progress is blocked at the top of the street by
a blank brick wall.

>w
You take a few tentative steps back down the lane, but it seems to lead only to
a short switchback, bringing you right back to the brick wall. You're not

Very faintly, from somewhere over the rooftops, you hear the faint, quavering
strains of a violin.

He takes the book up to the circulation desk and hands it to the librarian.
"Okay then," he says, returning, "let's go."

Michael suddenly smacks his forehead. "Oh, crap, I forgot to tell you. The car
broke down." He spreads his hands. "I don't know what happened to it; one second
I'm parking outside, the next second it dies and I can't get it started again. I
called a tow truck, but the nearest garage is up in Arkham. They picked it up
but won't be able to look at it until next week at the earliest. Anyway, it

Michael hurries to catch up.

Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

Michael follows you.

Overhead, the swollen clouds flicker ominously with a greenish haze of sheet
lightning.

Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is
possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides
by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this
city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to
the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley
Bridge.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking
grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of
some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

Michael hurries to catch up.

>w

Dark Corner
The rooftops above you lean so close together as to nearly block out the sky
altogether, making this a particularly dark and unpleasant section of the city.
The street leads away to the east, and a shadowy driveway leads through a high
brick wall to the south.

Michael hurries to catch up.

>s

Asylum Courtyard
The grim, white-washed edifice of Danvers Asylum bounds this tiny, shadowed
courtyard to the south, its narrow, barred windows staring blankly down at you
like ranks of shriveled, empty eye sockets. You can escape through a narrow
gateway in the high, brick wall to the north.

Michael hurries to catch up.

Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides
by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this

the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east

A sudden gust of wind blows a cold spray of rain into your face.

>e

Riverwalk
A low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep,
mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access
to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge.
The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The
town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.

Michael hurries to catch up.

>s

Chilly Avenue
Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky
waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems
perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads
lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.

A clammy mist hangs thickly in the air, seeping through your clothes and making
you shiver.

Michael follows you.

>sw
As you walk through, the mists part before your husband almost deferentially,
quickly dissolving away into nothing.

The ground begins to rise sharply as the road climbs up into the hills south of
town.

Scenic View
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in
the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the
grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the
paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding
ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east.
Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost
directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just
make out the shape of the obelisk from here.

Michael hurries to catch up.

>nw

Outside the House
The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by
gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of
your house, which lies north.

The fabled Verlac family mansion looms before you in the gloom, its dark
creaking presence dominating the clearing and, somehow, even though it is not
visible through the trees, the entire valley. The foreboding shadow of the
Verlacs seems to enshroud all of Anchorhead from here.

A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.

Michael hurries to catch up.

"Well," says Michael, "this must be the place. We finally made it, honey. We're
home!"

>read notice
It's a letter from the Arkham Regional Utilities Company, explaining that, due
to wiring difficulties, the electricity will not be installed until next week.
No phone service, either.

"Well, that's wonderful news," remarks Michael dryly, reading over your
shoulder.

Foyer
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels
cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high.
The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows,
and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not
a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and
timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

The front door stands open to the south.

Carelessly stacked in a towering heap in the middle of the room are all your
luggage and belongings, which you had sent ahead through a moving company before
driving up to Massachusetts. Everything you own is boxed away and piled up in
the middle of the floor. The reality of this move finally slams home as you
stare at the sprawling jumble of stuff, and suddenly you feel very lost and
adrift.

Night has now undeniably fallen, and the house is very, very dark. There is
probably just enough residual ambience to feel your way upstairs to the bedroom,
but the rest of the house is a tenebrous maze of shadows, and any exploring
would probably best be done in the morning.

Michael strolls along after you.

Michael stretches his arms and yawns. "Well," he says, "I think I'm going to
turn in. There'll be plenty of time to unpack and explore tomorrow. Good night,
hon." He kisses you on the cheek. "Don't stay up too late."

And with that, he goes upstairs.

A cold, noiseless draft coils through the narrow entrance hall. You shiver,
wondering where it came from.

Upstairs Landing
A narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the
house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.

>n

Master Bedroom
The master bedroom is a picture-postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded
sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing
mirror stands in one corner; an old-fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly
beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four-poster
bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house.

Michael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.

If it weren't for this hopelessly backwater town and the disturbing
circumstances surrounding the house, you'd say this was your dream home. Even
so, as much as you would like to relax and enjoy the comforts of a fully
furnished historical New England estate, you can't help but be put off by the
shady aura surrounding the family that used to live here. The last of the line,
you remind yourself, recently committed suicide after killing his wife and two
daughters with a shotgun. Involuntarily you shiver, glancing nervously at the
doorways to the south and west.

>get in bed
Gratefully, you remove your clothes, leave your things on the bedroom floor,
crawl into bed and pull the covers up to your chin.

Something is nagging at you, preventing you from sleeping... suddenly you

Almost immediately you fall asleep, and as the wind slithers around the eaves
and the house creaks furtive secrets to itself, you drift into troubling
dreams...







You are waiting in your bed, with the coverlet up under your chin, waiting for
Father to come tuck you in. Footsteps in the hall pause outside your door. You
close your eyes; when you open them again Father is standing at the foot of the
bed. His eyes are bloodshot, rimmed with red, and you wonder if he has been
crying. Slowly, he starts to take off his belt.

Only it's not your father after all, it's Michael. He hands you a golden sphere
and says:

"I don't know what it opens yet but I have an idea."

Your reflection is like a little doll trapped inside the sphere. Everything is
tinged with gold. Your face swells and stretches comically as you stare back at
yourself through the curved, distorting walls. Reaching out, your fingers curve
back on themselves... the wall breaks and...

You are running from the eyes, the terrible red-rimmed eyes, through endless,
narrow corridors of wooden slats and crumbling plaster. You stumble through turn
after turn, hopelessly lost. There is a small hole in the boards -- peering
through it you see Michael in the study, typing diligently away. You scream, you
pound on the wall, but he can't hear you. The red-rimmed eyes draw closer;
hurrying down a twisting passage you find a dead end... the wall breaks and...

Outside, you stand at another dead end, a high brick wall at the end of a steep,
twisting lane. Written in black spraypaint...

He always returns to his blood.

Behind you, you hear the buzzing of a fly. You turn...

[             * THE SECOND DAY *

It is hard to prevent the impression
of a faint, malign odour about the village
street, as of the massed mould and decay of
centuries. It is always a relief to get
clear of the place.

You wake up. Steam billows gently by, and you can hear the sound of running
water coming from the bathroom.

You can hear Michael splashing around, noisily enjoying his shower.

the bathroom, toweling his hair. "My, don't you look tempting this morning," he
says, giving you a kiss. He tosses the towel back into the bathroom and gets
dressed. "I think I'm going to stay home and get some writing done. I don't
actually start work until tomorrow, so..." He kisses you on the cheek as he
walks out into the hall. "If you go out today, see if you can find a newspaper.
I want to learn as much as I can about this town."

He looks at you for a moment, and his voice becomes serious. "I love you, hon.
You know that, don't you? I really want us to try and be happy here."

Then he turns and pads down the hall.

You take a deep breath as he goes. You've never lied to Michael or hidden
anything from him before, ever; now, hardly two days into your new life, you're
already sneaking through his wallet.

Oh yeah. You're off to a great start.

Dining Room
Much of the elegance has faded from this room. The huge dining table running the
length of it is covered with a thick gray film of dust, and the china cupboard
standing against the far wall is draped in shadow. Doorways to the north and
east offer little relief from the gloom. For what must be the hundredth time,

Kitchen
Where once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen
walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks.
Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back
door to the north leads out of the house.

Someone's flashlight is lying on the kitchen counter; one of the movers must
have left it.

An odd feeling of gloom overtakes you momentarily, and you find yourself
thinking about the Verlac family's personal effects -- the everyday mundanities,
such as kitchen utensils. Were they thrown out, or donated to charity, or
auctioned off as grisly souvenirs? What about the canned goods? Did anyone think
to take them? The cabinets might even still be stocked. Morbidly, you wonder
what Mrs. Edward Verlac might have been cooking for dinner the night her husband
blew her head off.

>get flashlight

Cellar
The old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the
sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons
the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar
extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a
hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.

One largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the
far wall.

Storage
Old crates and boxes piled high against the walls make this room seem even
smaller and dingier than it actually is, which is saying a lot. A doorway lies
north; the other walls contain nothing but shadows and dirt-filled corners.

>search crates
You spend some time poking dispiritedly through boxes of second-hand table
settings, discarded shoes and outdated encyclopedias, but the only thing you
manage to dig up is an old cardboard box full of newspaper clippings, which
might make interesting reading later if you can find the time. The only thing at
all noteworthy about the room, in fact, is that it desperately wants cleaning;
there's even a big, nasty-looking spider web in a corner behind one of the
crates.

CHURCH CLOSED, PREACHER SUSPECT IN
COMMUNIST CRACKDOWN

The  Church of Celestial Wisdom
in  Anchorhead, Massachusetts  was
shut  down  and  its  congregation
disbanded  yesterday   after   its
pastor,  the Rev. Mordecai Verlac,
70, was  accused  of  distributing
Communist propaganda to  his pari-
shioners.  Authorities  in  Arkham
were informed by an anonymous call
two days earlier.
"The caller  told  us  that the
Reverend  was  'preaching not from
the Good Book, but from a terrible
book,'  and that he had been warn-
ing  them   about  some   kind  of
'invasion'  or  'great event' that
would  be  happening  soon,"  said
Sgt. Biedermeyer  of  the   Arkham
Police Department. "It smelled Red
to me,  so I made  the decision to
call our HUAC representative up in
Salem."
The  raid   commenced   shortly
after  morning  services  began at
8:00  am,  in  order to confiscate
printed  material  and  catch  any
possible accomplices  before  they
could hide or destroy evidence. No
officers  who participated  in the
raid  were available for  comment,
although one man coming out of the
building afterwards  was allegedly
overheard saying that it was  "the
worst thing he'd ever seen."
The  Church of Celestial Wisdom
was founded in 1860  by  Rev. Ver-
lac's grandfather,  the  notorious
orator and painter  Elijah Verlac.
The building,  which is considered
by many to be  a  historical land-

Any information regarding the whereabouts of Daryl Beasley, age 9, should be
reported immediately to the Anchorhead police. Daryl was last seen by his mother
after she dropped him off at the Route 20 bus stop, just north of Old Mill Town
Road, at 8:30 am three days ago. He was not there when the bus made its
scheduled stop at 8:36 am.

Daryl is 4'10" tall, of slight build, with brown hair and brown eyes. At the
time of his disappearance, he was wearing brown corduroy pants, blue sneakers,
and a white, short-sleeved button-down shirt.

PAINTING SELLS FOR 1000£, SIGHT
UNSEEN

The  infamous  mystic  Aleister
Crowley purchased a painting at an
auction  at   Sotheby's  for  1000
pounds sterling on Monday  without
so much  as glancing  at  it.  The
painting,  entitled  "The Legacy",
is  by  the  late  American Elijah
Verlac,  and  was sold  along with
numerous   other    pieces   by  a
representative   of    the  Verlac
estate.
Crowley  reportedly strode into
the  auction   room  wearing  full
ceremonial robes  and  immediately
bid 1000£ -- well  over  twice the
going bid.  He ordered it  wrapped
and transported immediately to his
home.  It  is  not  known  whether
Crowley had ever seen the painting
before arriving at the auction.
"I've  never seen anything like
it,"  said  Sir Walton  Radcliffe,
Esq., presiding auctioneer for the
Verlac exhibit, "but I suppose one
might  expect such behavior from a
person  who  calls  himself,  'The
Great Beast'."
Mordecai    Verlac,    Elijah's
grandson  and   executor   of  the
Verlac estate,  was not present at
the  auction.  Crowley  has stated
that he  has  never  met  Mordecai
Verlac  and has  no desire  to. "I
encountered  Verlac  in  a  former
life,"  he is reported  as saying,
"and I would not  do so again  for
all the kingdoms in Hades.  He has
gone where I dare not."
Elijah Verlac  is known  by art
historians  more for his grotesque

BONES DISCOVERED IN WOODS, CHILD
FEARED DEAD

The  bones   of   what   police
believe  to  be a small child were
discovered   yesterday   by   pic-
nickers  in  the  woods near Birch
Road,  just  south  of Anchorhead.
Police  have  drawn no conclusions
as  yet,  but  there  is  a strong
suspicion  that  the  bones may be
the  remains  of Christopher Till-
worth,  who  disappeared near that
area two weeks ago.
Sgt. Ronald  Franklin  of   the
Arkham  police was not optimistic.
"We   have  contacted   the  boy's
mother,  and are trying to prepare
her  for  the worst," he said. "No
one  here  wants  to  give up hope
prematurely,   but   the   general
feeling  here is,  we've found the
boy."
The remains, which consisted of
a femur  and  partial  skull,  are
being shipped to a forensic lab in
Boston   for   further   analysis.
Rumors that  the  bones  displayed
teeth marks consistent with animal
bites are so far unsubstantiated.
Christopher,  who  would  have
turned 7 on the 19th, is the fifth
child  to  disappear  in  the last

RESPECTED PHYSICIAN RETIRES
UNEXPECTEDLY

Dr. Timothy Rebis,  a respected
obstetrician  at Arkham Sisters of
Mercy  Hospital  for  the  last 20
years,  announced  his  retirement
yesterday  to  a  stunned Board of
Directors.
He gave  no reason  for his un-
expected decision.
"I  am  truly  stunned,"   said
Bernard  Talbot,  Chairman  of the
Board. "No one saw this coming. No
one."
A  source  within  the hospital
who  wished  to  remain  anonymous
ascribed  the  doctor's abrupt de-
parture  to  a  nervous breakdown,
but  this  has not  been confirmed
by any of Dr. Rebis' colleagues.

ANTHROPOLOGIST TURNED AWAY IN
PROPERTY DISPUTE

Prominent  anthropologist   Dr.
Joseph Corbin's  repeated attempts
to secure permission  to set up an
archeological   dig   in    nearby
Anchorhead  came to an end yester-
day  when he lost his suit against
the Rev. Mordecai Verlac. The case
has  been  pending  for  over  six
months.
The  Rev. Verlac  has  strongly
disputed  Corbin's right to dig in
the area, contending that the land
in   question   belongs   to   the
ancestral  Verlac  estate  and  is
therefore  his  private  property.
Last week,  Rev. Verlac's  lawyers
presented conclusive  evidence  of
prior  ownership,  and  the  judge
quickly ruled in his favor.
Dr. Corbin,  who  is  a protégé
and  close personal friend  of the
noted folklorist  Dr. J. Arnsworth
Frazer,  hoped to discover  relics
of   the   little-known    Misquat
Indian culture,  which is believed
to have  inhabited this area  cen-
turies prior  to European  settle-
ment.  Corbin called  the decision
"a travesty".
Many expected scholars at near-
by   Miskaton University  to rally
behind  Corbin's battle,  but most

CONFLAGRATION CLAIMS PAPER MILL --
AGAIN

Arkham firefighters worked late
into the night yesterday, battling
a blaze that brought  Anchorhead's
historic paper mill  to the ground
despite their best efforts.
The mill,  which  provides jobs
for  roughly   two-thirds  of  the
town's  population,   caught  fire
yesterday around 4:00 pm. Although
there  have been rumors  of an ex-
plosion,  the  exact cause  of the
fire remains unknown.
Fire Inspector Donald Brown re-
mains puzzled.  "There is evidence
of chemical burns  that are incon-
sistent with the materials used in
paper  manufacture,"  he  told re-
porters. "There's metal fused with
metal in there...  it's all messed
up."
Interestingly,  this is not the
first time the Anchorhead mill has
burned.   The  original  mill  was
built  by  Wilhelm  Verlac  in the
latter  part of  the 17th century,
and  historical  records  indicate
that it burned down after only ten
years.  The  mill  was  rebuilt by
Wilhelm's grandson,  Heinrich Ver-
lac,  a  few  decades  later. This
one  lasted  until shortly  before
the  Civil War  --  and some still
hold  that it was  burned down  by
Confederate sympathizers.
The  current  mill was  rebuilt
in 1922 by Heinrich's great-great-
grandson,  Rev.  Mordecai  Verlac.
Mordecai,  in addition  to being a
fiery preacher  and outspoken Pro-
hibitionist, was quite wealthy and
owned numerous  and widespread in-
vestments.  At the age of 70, this
controversial  figure  was accused

the young couple. She has long, dark hair and a serious expression; he, although
only in his twenties, is already starting to bald a little. You find yourself
unable to tear your eyes away from his face for some time. It seems open and
guileless, and he is clearly very happy. There is no hint there of the nightmare
his world would one day become.)

Storage
Old crates and boxes piled high against the walls make this room seem even
smaller and dingier than it actually is, which is saying a lot. A doorway lies
north; the other walls contain nothing but shadows and dirt-filled corners.

You can see an old-fashioned iron key here.

Cellar
The old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the
sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons
the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar
extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a
hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.

One largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the
far wall.

>x wires
The wiring runs back and forth across the ceiling in every direction -- wrapped
around timbers, in and out of rusted, broken conduits, crossing and re-crossing
itself in a dozen places. You can see several places where the insulation is
cracked or stripped altogether. It's enough to send any self-respecting fire
marshall into conniptions.

Gratefully, you leave the clammy confines of the cellar behind.

The pantry is empty save for a layer of dust on the shelves. A door to the south

Where once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen

All of them are bizarre, and most of them border on the grotesque. Alien

up the bulk of the paintings' subject matter. And yet, despite the fantastical
nature of the images painted, the style is neither abstract nor surreal. In
fact, the level of detail approaches the photorealistic. Excruciating attention
has been paid to light, shadows, and textures; even the alien creatures are
depicted with gruesome anatomical accuracy. It is as though the artist had
worked from actual, living models rather than from what must have been a
thoroughly deranged imagination, and the overall effect is rather chilling.

One scene in particular catches your eye.

A somewhat Boschian scene, depicting a line of naked, emaciated men, their
ankles shackled and chained together, shuffling forward to offer obeisance to
the glowing maw of an enormous furnace. The men are malnourished and covered
with terrible burns. The foremost is kneeling, offering... something, you can't
make out what... up to the mouth of flames, while the rest stand as far back as
they are able, their heads bowed in what appears to be fear and penitence. It
isn't clear where this is supposed to be taking place; beyond the fiery glow
there is nothing but soot-filled, Stygian blackness. An artist's rendition of
Hell, perhaps?

For some reason, you are reminded of old photographs of the Nazi death camps, in
which Jews were forced to feed the ovens with the corpses of their own.

You shake yourself suddenly, and realize you've been staring intently at the

A group of old midwives cluster around a bed-ridden woman who is apparently
giving birth. The old women are wizened and grim, with crooked hands and
bloodstained aprons. They seem to confer with each other in dark whispers that
the younger woman, who is drenched in sweat and obviously in great pain, cannot
hear. By the corner of the bed, an ominous detail: a bucket full of murky, red
water.

Strangely, though, the old women are not the only ones present at the birth.
Nearby, in another bed, lies a shriveled, decrepit old man. Although seemingly
at death's door, he struggles to raise himself, as if to see the birthing over
the heads of the hunched midwives. His wasted visage shows an expression of
satisfaction or approval, and he is reaching out with one skeletal arm in a
manner curiously similar to the famous picture on the Sistine Chapel, of God
giving life to His creation Adam.

A group of white men in Revolutionary period clothing, taking prisoner a group
of Native Americans. The exact situation is unclear: the white men stand around
with muskets threatening, while the natives, who are chained together, file into
a fenced enclosure, as though being herded into a compound of some sort.

In the extreme background, at the far end of the enclosure, stands a large brick
building. Dark, grainy smoke billows up from two stone chimneys rising above the
structure. Leaning very close, you can just make out another group of natives
being herded into the structure by more of the white men.

A young apprentice butcher learns his trade in a slaughterhouse. The older man
-- heavyset, thick jaw and sloping brow -- holds his cleaver above a severed
calf's head, looking expectantly at the boy as though demonstrating the proper
technique. The boy, holding a smaller cleaver of his own, looks on attentively.
It would be reminiscent of something by Norman Rockwell, except for the frankly
alarming amount of gore. The aprons and faces of both master and apprentice are
streaked with blood; blood pools on the chopping block and overspills the
gutters; blood drips from the walls and from the skinned carcasses that can be
seen hanging in the background. The two butchers stand ankle-deep in a reeking
abattoir.

And... there's something wrong with the boy. Most of his body is hidden behind
the chopping block, but there are details about the parts you can see that...
don't seem to fit quite right. The arm holding the cleaver is slightly
misshapen, for example, the fingers deformed in a way that you can't quite make
out. And his neck seems just a bit too thick, and his head seems just a bit too
large and blocky. His face looks normal enough, except that it seems to have
been placed just slightly off-center. It's a very subtly disturbing effect.

A group of primitive tribesmen dance within a ring of standing stones, beneath a
lightning-streaked sky. Their dress and some of the fetishes they carry --
feathers, rattles, ceremonial masks -- all seem to represent a Native American
culture, but the men themselves are... strange. They look truly savage and
degenerate, in a way that you don't often see Native Americans depicted. Peering
closely, you can see that some of them even appear to be deformed.

Overlooking the dance stands a tall obelisk on a hill, silhouetted against the
storm clouds above. The artist added a strange effect to the cloud formations
directly above the obelisk; the color and shading seem to suggest a red, baleful
eye looking down upon the strange ritual below.

You shake yourself suddenly, and realize you've been staring intently at the

of you. None of the other paintings have moved as far as you can tell, but that
particular scene seems to have disappeared without leaving so much as a blank

up the bulk of the paintings' subject matter. And yet, despite the fantastical
nature of the images painted, the style is neither abstract nor surreal. In
fact, the level of detail approaches the photorealistic. Excruciating attention
has been paid to light, shadows, and textures; even the alien creatures are
depicted with gruesome anatomical accuracy. It is as though the artist had
worked from actual, living models rather than from what must have been a

The simple but striking image of five young women being burned to death at the
stake. Around them stand a crowd of men and women dressed in rustic, 17th
century clothing; they jeer and throw stones. The ringleader, standing in front
of the five glowing pyres with the smoking torch still in his hand, wears a
clergyman's collar.

The artist obviously went to painstaking lengths to depict the burning in
ghastly detail: skin curling away from blackened flesh; hair shriveling; eyes
boiling in their sockets and melting across cracked and splitting cheeks...
repeated five times over, on the bodies of five thrashing, screaming girls. It
turns your stomach to look at.

Sitting Room
The east wall is occupied by a beautiful antique sofa, and a large, hand-woven
rug covers the hardwood floor. The huge marble fireplace in the north wall helps
complete the impression of comfort and warmth, and for a moment or two you can
almost think of this place as somewhere you could live, as opposed to merely
somewhere others have died. The foyer lies west, and a doorway to the left of
the fireplace leads north.

Your brief sense of comfort quickly drains away, however, as you become aware of
the icy and maniacal stare emanating from the great portrait hanging over the
mantelpiece. Under the malefic gaze of those red-rimmed eyes, the most
comforting thought you can muster is that of immediate flight.

On the sofa is a family album.

>get album
You pick up the family album. It's a slim, hardbound volume in dark leather,
unadorned except for name "Verlac" embossed on the front. Glancing at the title
page, you notice two details: one, the book was self-published; and two, it was
published in 1944. So it's a good bet that Edward Verlac and his family aren't
mentioned here.

>read album
The book contains portraits and brief biographies (although, strangely, no birth
or death dates) on some two hundred members of the Verlac clan, from the central
family figures to the distant second cousins. If you want to read about someone
in here, you'll have to look them up by name.

>look up wilhelm in album
The entry reads:

Wilhelm Verlac
Fled with mother Eustacia Verlac during the Witch Burnings of 1653; returned
to Anchorhead in 1663; elected mayor of Anchorhead in 1690; built the Miskaton
River Mill in 1695; began construction of the lighthouse in 1706.

The picture is a reproduction of a charcoal sketch, probably done when he was a
younger man. The similarities to the portrait in the sitting room is evident,
though: the patrician nose; the harsh, thin line of the mouth; the lean, wolfish
jaw. It is the eyes, however, that carry the true family resemblance. Even in
the rough, colorless strokes of charcoal, you can see that they are edged with
the same raw madness that haunts the red-tinged gaze of the sitting room
portrait.

>look up heinrich in album
The entry reads:

Heinrich Verlac
Added cupola to the Verlac Estate in 1759; elected mayor of Anchorhead in
1765; rebuilt the Miskaton River Mill in 1770; led the battle of Quattac Bend in
the Misquat Uprising of 1772; arrested as a Royalist sympathizer in 1777 but
subsequently cleared of all charges; completed construction of the lighthouse in
1795.

The portrait is of Heinrich as an older man, in his late fifties, perhaps. The
German ancestry shows through more clearly here, in the set of his jaw and the
line of his forehead. The eyes burn with aggressive pride... and perhaps a
little of the madness which stained the gaze of his ancestors as well.

>look up elijah in album
The entry reads:

Elijah Verlac
Traveled to Europe in 1824 to study painting and to research the Verlac
genealogy; returned to Anchorhead in 1832; entered the seminary at Arkham
College in 1834; ordained in 1844; began construction of the Church of Celestial
Wisdom in Anchorhead in 1860; accused of Confederate sympathies in 1862; retired
from the clergy and devoted life to painting in 1873.

On of the earliest photographic portraits in the album, it depicts a man in his
sixties, at least. His face is deeply scored by time, his skin mottled with
liver spots, his long, gray hair swept back from a high, bony forehead. This man
resembles the portrait in the sitting room more than any of the others, for he
has practically the same eyes -- the raw, bloodshot madness staring out from
hollow caves in his skull.

You note one other interesting detail: he appears to have an extra digit, a
sixth finger, on his right hand.

>look up mordecai in album
The entry reads:

Mordecai Verlac
Currently residing in Anchorhead; attended seminary at Arkham College in
1906; ordained in 1912; re-established the Church of Celestial Wisdom in 1920;
rebuilt the Miskaton River Mill in 1922.

The photograph depicts a man who has returned to his Puritan roots: dressed in
spartan black, hair clipped in an archaic tonsure, clutching a Bible in his lap
as he glares stoically at the camera. This is the kind of man who would whip his
children for laughing on Sunday. His eyes still carry the Verlac madness,
burning with single-minded righteousness.

>look up eustacia in album
The entry reads:

Eustacia Verlac
Born to Croseus Verlac; gave birth to one son, Wilhelm; fled Anchorhead
during the Witch Burnings of 1653; remained in hiding in Arkham for 10 years,
then returned with son in 1663; died 1686.

The woman in the portrait is strikingly beautiful, with jet black hair that
hangs down past her shoulders like a shining, velvet curtain. There is some
resemblance to the thin, cruel features of her father, but not the ragged, red-
tinged madness about the eyes. Eustacia's eyes are not red at all; they are cold
and deep and very dark.

>look up croseus in album
The entry reads:

Croseus Verlac
Born the son of a provincial cabinet-maker in the Höllental Valley circa
1590; fled Germany in 1620 to avoid charges of heresy; came to the New World in
1622 on the ship Dawn Maiden; founded the town of Anchorhead in 1624; began
construction of Verlac estate in 1625; signed the non-aggression pact with Chief
Chuaquacqat of the Misquat tribe in 1631.

The picture is a full-page black-and-white reproduction of the portrait hanging
in the sitting room. Underneath it, someone has scribbled in pencil:

his is our blood
he always returns to his blood

Foyer
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels
cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high.
The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows,
and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not
a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and
timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.

Library
Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to
shun the printed word. Books line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark-
paneled, green-carpeted room, interrupted only by doorways to the east and
south. A rich, brown leather armchair sits in stately repose near the window,
with a polished brass pipe stand nearby completing the picture of some blue-
blooded country squire's literary refuge. Once again, you are struck by how
easily this place could have been the perfect home.

A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors stand closed to the east.

Resting on the pipe stand is a sizable volume decorated with a gilded pentagram
on its cover.

>get volume
(The Compleat Manual of Wardes and Seales)
(slipping the flashlight into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
You pick up The Compleat Manual of Wardes and Seales. It's an old medieval tome
dated in the early 1300s, written by one Galarian Academius desChamps.

>read volume
Which do you mean, the bookshelves or The Compleat Manual of Wardes and Seales?

>compleat manual
Essentially, it's a textbook on the theory and practice of magickal wards and
seals, mystic symbols inscribed on doors and containers in order to keep people
and spirits out -- or in. It's all very deliberately vague and arcane (in
addition to being written in medieval French and translated into Middle English,
making it nearly impossible to understand), the kind of thing that likely got
many a scholar burned at the stake in those days.

You are surprised to find that a page in this old and probably quite valuable
book has been folded down, as though to mark the place. The section marked
discusses various methods of opening doors that have been sealed with the image
of a pagan god. Speaking aloud the deity's true name will usually do the trick,
apparently.

>x bookshelf
Literally hundreds of books stuff the shelves, many of them thick, cracked,
leather-bound tomes with ribbon place-holders and titles lettered in raised gold

does catch your eye. An authentic first printing of Edgar Allen Poe's Tales of
Mystery and Imagination, shelved incongruously between volumes "G" and "H" of
the Encyclopedia Americana.

>get poe
The book sticks stubbornly at first, and, thinking that it must be tightly

master bedroom, its bright coverlet providing one of the few feeble splashes of
color in what must have been, for most of its history, a joylessly Puritan

under the window stands an ancient crib. The only exit is to the north.

You idly wonder if this might have been the diary of one of Edward Verlac's
daughters -- but then you notice part of a date, just visible in the corner of
the page: 1953. This must have been written, then, several years before Edward
was born.

The entries that are legible read as follows:

...Father came again to my bed last night... mother doesn't... tells me I
can't... to be a good daughter. Sometimes it hurts, but Father always tells me I
shouldn't cry. Father says a daughter must do her Duty if she wants to get into
Heaven. And I do want to get into Heaven...

[this entry dated 1957] ...my poor little William. Father calls him an
aberration, child of the Devil, but I don't believe... locked in the attic. I go
to see him whenever Father is away. I sing to him, sometimes, through the
keyhole, and slip him sweets through the crack under the door... my baby is
beautiful... can't let him hurt my dear baby William... to the doctor, and he
has a plan... I can never... this locket, William, and I will always keep
yours... to always remember my face...

Nothing else is readable except for one fragmented entry near the very end of
the book, the date in the corner reading February 27, 1961:

...dead, but not dead yet... will not allow him to do to Edward what he wanted
to do to William... have learned... given him the charm against the... never
take it off, dear Edward... [a page has been torn away] ...fear to sleep... mist

And that's all.

northwest, framed by crooked trees with overhanging branches that seem to form a
stunted, jagged archway into the dim recesses of the forest.

Stooping to avoid the sharp, bare twigs that snag your clothes and seem to reach
greedily for your eyes, you pick your way through the undergrowth to a small

Old, moss-slimed tombstones, many broken off and leaning crazily like an old
man's teeth, poke up from the soft, mulchy earth. In their midst stands an
ancient marble crypt, its heavy iron door nearly obscured by thick draperies of
ivy. The trees press close around this quiet enclave of death, leaning together
over your head as if sharing secrets. A gap in the undergrowth to the southeast

A gravel path starts here at the back door of the house, and marks a trail
nearly overgrown by weeds and briars. It disappears into the undergrowth to the
northwest, framed by crooked trees with overhanging branches that seem to form a
stunted, jagged archway into the dim recesses of the forest.

>nw
Stooping to avoid the sharp, bare twigs that snag your clothes and seem to reach
greedily for your eyes, you pick your way through the undergrowth to a small
clearing.

Family Plot
Old, moss-slimed tombstones, many broken off and leaning crazily like an old
man's teeth, poke up from the soft, mulchy earth. In their midst stands an
ancient marble crypt, its heavy iron door nearly obscured by thick draperies of
ivy. The trees press close around this quiet enclave of death, leaning together
over your head as if sharing secrets. A gap in the undergrowth to the southeast
reveals a narrow gravel path.

>enter
The faint echo of dripping water and a musty smell of decay grow stronger as you
descend.

In the Crypt
The air is clammy and frigid, the stone walls damp and streaked with mud and
lichen. Pale, swollen roots push through cracks in the masonry. The smell of
damp corruption is almost overpowering here, though the stairs to the south lead
toward fresher air.

The walls of this chamber contain dozens of wide, shallow niches; in each niche,
a coffin.

>look up william on nameplate
What do you want to look that up in?

>nameplate
The nameplate reads "William Verlac, b. June 22, 1954, d. September 18, 1958".
Unlike the others, William's coffin is a ramshackle affair of cheap pine, held
together with rusting nails. It's half-rotten with age and so shabbily built you
could probably open it with your bare hands.

>open william's coffi n
I only understood you as far as wanting to open William's coffin.

>open william's coffin
Compelled by a gruesome curiosity, you dig your fingers under the soft, rotting
boards and pry up the lid. With the shriek of pulling nails and a shower of
crumbling wood, the coffin comes open, and you look inside, expecting to find a
child's tiny skeleton...

Dear God.

There's no child buried here. Instead, the coffin contains only the worm-eaten
bones of some kind of animal.

Who would have buried an animal in place of the child that should have been
interred here? And why would they do such a thing? Glumly, you look around at
the rest of the coffins, and realize that anyone who might have known the
answers to these questions is probably already buried in this room.

>x bones
You're no veterinarian, but these cannot possibly be the bones of a human child.
A dog seems most likely, at a rough guess.

>get bones
The skeleton is in pieces; parts of it crumble even as you touch it. Only the

You involuntary take a deep breath of fresh air as you leave the clammy, foetid

Where once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen

Library
Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to
shun the printed word. Books line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark-
paneled, green-carpeted room, interrupted only by doorways to the east and
south. A rich, brown leather armchair sits in stately repose near the window,
with a polished brass pipe stand nearby completing the picture of some blue-
blooded country squire's literary refuge. Once again, you are struck by how
easily this place could have been the perfect home.

A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors stand closed to the east.

A section of the shelves in the western wall has slid to one side, revealing a

You can also see a cardboard box (in which are some newspaper clippings) here.

Scenic View
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in
the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the
grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the
paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding
ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east.
Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost
directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just
make out the shape of the obelisk from here.

>ne

Chilly Avenue
Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky
waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems
perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads
lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.

>n

Riverwalk
A low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep,
mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access
to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge.
The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The
town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.

Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides
by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this

the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley
Bridge.

A damp newspaper lies on the curb, fluttering slightly in the wind.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking
grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of
some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

The front page story is about Jeffrey Greer, 8 years old, who was abducted from
his home at #11 Mill Town Road last night. Little Jeffrey is the latest victim
in a series of abductions that stretches back for years, one every six months or
so, and that authorities believe is the work of a single perpetrator. Local
police had hoped to prove that Edward Verlac had been behind the kidnappings,
but were unable to obtain a confession or any hard proof. Edward Verlac was
convicted of murdering his wife and two daughters, one of whom was 15 months
old, in January of this year; he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and
incarcerated in Danvers Asylum, where he remained until committing suicide last
March. This latest kidnapping, occurring after Edward's death, seems to have
cleared up any lingering suspicions that he might have been the culprit.

Anyone possessing information regarding the whereabouts of Jeffrey Greer is
strongly urged to speak to the authorities as soon as possible.

>x obelisk
The obelisk measures about two feet square at its base, narrowing slightly as it
rises a good fifteen feet to a bluntly pointed tip. An iron ring is embedded in
the stone high up on one side, about two feet from the top. Dense, twisting
hieroglyphs cover all four sides of the obelisk, although they are too worn to
be read clearly.

>x hieroglyphs
They are not Egyptian, which is what you first assumed from the general shape
and design of the obelisk. In fact, though you're no archaeologist, these
carvings don't look like any sort of ancient writing you've ever seen. The
characters, which must have been carved very deeply in order to survive this
much erosion, twist and squirm in disturbing ways, flowing into and through each
other and almost seeming to shift slightly as you try to follow their lines. The
effect is deeply unsettling, and you have to suppress an urge to take a step or
two back away from the monument.

A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is

into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for
its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most
extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer
Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage
and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they

A high counter divides the public portion of the library from the reserved

Introduction
Rituals of the Misquat Indians
The Dark Man and Other Aspects
The 'Strangling Mist' Legend
The 'Ghost Train' Legend


[Please press SPACE.]


This chapter deals with the strange mythology surrounding the person of Croseus
Verlac, the first of the American Verlacs, who immigrated from the Black Forest
region of Germany in the early 1600s. He settled in the Miskaton Valley and
there helped establish the small fishing port soon to be known as Anchorhead.

Croseus sired six raven-haired daughters and schooled all of them at home. The
girls were reclusive and odd of habit, and by the time the eldest turned fifteen
the town had all but openly accused them of witchcraft. The townsfolk shunned
the Verlac daughters and called them "the Old Man's Coven" -- although never
within earshot, since Croseus was already a very powerful and influential man in
that region.

Although he never had a son, Croseus apparently sired a number of grandsons by
more than one of his daughters -- ostensibly to keep the Verlac blood pure, such
practice being not uncommon in the more secluded and xenophobic early
settlements. However, most of the male children were born dead, or horribly
deformed, or both, and there were furtive whispers that Croseus was practicing
some form of dark sorcery on his progeny. The fact that Croseus fell ill on the
day that the first healthy male child was born (to his youngest daughter), and
died before day's end, did not go unnoticed.

After Croseus died, the townspeople turned against the "coven", burning all of
them to death except for Eustacia, the youngest, who managed to escape along
with her infant son, Wilhelm. She returned some years later, after an outbreak
of smallpox wiped out much of the town's older population, including the
Calvinist minister and every last man and woman who had participated in the
burning of Verlac's brood.

With a start, you remember the pattern you uncovered in the city archives --
each Verlac dying on the very day his grandson is born... no parents listed on
the birth certificates... no marriage records, only sons then daughters then
sons... and a sickening, horrifying thought begins to take shape: what if the
foul tradition begun by Croseus Verlac did not end with his death?

What if, for centuries, the Verlacs have been raping their own daughters in
order to sire grandsons?

What in God's name was wrong with this family? How could this have gone on for
so long without anyone knowing about it or trying to stop it? And why does each
Verlac die on the very day his grandson is born?

Edward Verlac, the man from whom Michael inherited the house and all its
madness, must have been the last of his line, the child of his mother and his
mother's own father. He went insane and killed his entire family, and now his
legacy has been passed on to your husband. With a sudden rush of urgency and
fear, you realize that you have to get out of this town, and you have to get
Michael out with you, as soon as humanly possible.

Little is known about the enigmatic Misquat Indians. They are believed to have
occupied a small, unobtrusive area around southeastern Massachusetts, along the
banks of the river which now bears their name. At the time that this book was
published, various property disputes prevented any thorough archaeological
investigation of the area; information regarding this tiny, sequestered tribe is
therefore scarce and based largely on hearsay and folklore.

Analysis of the only known fossil -- a partial skull -- has led some
anthropologists to conclude that the Misquat were not indigenous to the region.
One popular theory holds that the tribe is most closely related to certain
degenerate branches of the northern Esquimeaux, and were perhaps driven from
their original sub-arctic clime and forced to settle in exile in what would
become the northeastern United States.

Although precious few physical artifacts have been recovered -- chief among them
a pair of ritual masks and a crudely carved, seven-holed wind instrument -- tall
tales of Misquat ritual abound. They appear to have been a unilaterally reviled
tribe. Most of the whispered stories involve horrid, ululating chants around
blazing bonfires in the dead of winter night, grotesque copulations performed in
honor of bestial gods, and of course abundant human sacrifice. The Misquat were
generally known as child-stealers, creeping through open windows at night to
perpetrate foul kidnappings. None of these claims can of course be verified;
nearly all Indian tribes encountered by the first European settlers have been
subject to such prejudices at one time or another.

It is known that the Misquat were most likely star-worshippers, and possessed
what was likely a quite complex theology involving entities that dwelled beyond
"the bowl of tiny fires" -- their term for the night sky. These entities granted
wisdom or insanity, bestowed prosperity or famine, according to how well or how
laxly the tribe performed its ritual appeasements. The rituals attempted to
contact or possibly summon aspects of these entities through elaborately carved
"beacons" -- mounds of stones or obelisks placed at significant geographical
locations.

The few eroded hieroglyphs left by them (oddly, the Misquat were one of the few
North American tribes to have developed a system of writing prior to any contact
with Europeans) have proved a compelling but so far intractable puzzle for
linguists today; all further detail about their ritual and mythology remains yet
a mystery.

Nearly all of the early European settlements circulated stories of a being known
as "The Dark Man" that lived in the primordial woods beyond the settlements'
borders. Deeply religious and at the same time almost hysterically
superstitious, clinging precariously to the edges of an unexplored and therefore
terrifying continent, it was only natural for people in those times to project
their collective fears onto the unknown. For the predominantly fundamentalist
Protestant sects that first colonized the New World, these projections typically
were embodiments of the Christian concept of the Devil.

The Dark Man generally takes the form of a man, sometimes of large or even giant
stature but more often no larger than a natural human. He is invariably dark-
skinned, although rarely described as a Negro -- most often he is a Caucasian
with jet-black skin, thus combining the refined, cunning intelligence of the
European with the base carnality of the African. He is regularly portrayed as
the consort of witches. He has many names: The Dark Man, The Grinning Man, Old
Scratch, Springheel Jack, The Evil One, etc., but always his formal, Biblical
appellation -- "Lucifer" or "Satan" -- is scrupulously avoided, a holdover from
the tradition that to speak a demon's name is to attract his attention and
perhaps even summon him.

More interesting to the folklorist are the names that harken further back than
these simple Christian superstitions, recalling a more pagan portrayal of the
dark and unknown. These tales, which originate from the more reclusive colonies,
often bring out the more animalistic, nature-worshipping aspect of the Dark Man.
He is sometimes pictured as being covered with hair, or having hooves instead of
feet, resembling Classical images of Pan. His names are more obscure: The Wicker
(or Wicca) Man; The Black Goat With A Thousand Young. Therein lie tantalizing
clues offering the enterprising folklorist still deeper glimpses into the
collective unconscious.

A few rare instances of The Dark Man have been uncovered that point beyond even
these antiquated references -- bizarre aspects that seem to reflect some of the
less understood concepts of Native American mysticism. Such baroque names as
"The Lurker At The Threshold" or "The Watcher Beyond The Stars" point to a
substratum of human mythology as yet untouched. These versions typically
describe not physical manifestations, but rather abstract concepts of Evil and
Time that some scholars have linked to the pre-Roman god Saturn, before he
became characterized as merely the father of Zeus, when he was instead
identified with the Ouroburos Dragon, Devourer of Worlds. Hopefully, as more
archaeological evidence is uncovered, we will be able to speak of these
primordial connections with greater confidence.

Rather unique to the lower Miskaton River Valley, this tale centers around a
seemingly malevolent fog that roams the forests and lonely night roads, choking
the unwary traveler with invisible, untouchable hands.

The experience of being attacked by this strange entity is described in an 1855
journal as: "...lyke as thowe a deade man were to put his corpsey fingers downe
yr throate withe one hande, & up yr nostrille withe the other..."

No two tellings can agree on the origins of this terrible mist. Some accounts
insist that it is a spirit of the restless dead; others attribute the effect to
malicious hobgoblins. Other versions implicate witchcraft, a pirate's curse,
swamp faerie... the list goes on. Some of the more esoteric explanations seem to
indicate that the legend was adapted by white settlers from native superstitions
held by the tribes indigenous to the Miskaton region; however, there is no
evidence as yet that the "strangling mist" existed in any form prior to the
appearance of Europeans.

Yet another colorful folk legend involves the recurring image of a "ghost train"
-- a spectral locomotive that materializes from nowhere, glides across the
haunted track for a short period of time, and then disappears as mysteriously as
it came.

This story did not originate among the first white settlers, of course;
obviously it only came into being after the advent of the steam locomotive in
our burgeoning Machine Age. The earliest known recorded version of this story,
in fact, is dated 1882. Nonetheless, the legend provides us with an interesting
example of how the collective unconscious adapts itself to changing aspects of
our culture, cloaking old symbolism in the trappings of new technology.

Although many versions hold that the ghost train represents the ghastly echoes
of a locomotive that was wrecked (derailed and lost off a mountain pass is the
most popular means of destruction), this is in fact a simplistic interpretation
not seen until many decades after the myth originated. More intriguing and more
useful to the folklorist are versions that explain the ghost train as a
transport to the land of the dead -- a modernized boat of Charon, ferrying
damned souls across the shroud to the devil's newly industrial Hell. These are
the versions which most faithfully maintain links to the traditions of the past,
and demonstrate the curious evolutionary behavior of the myth.

In some of these tellings, the traveling soul must have a ticket to present to
the grim conductor -- an element directly analogous to the ancient custom of
placing of gold coins beneath the tongue to buy passage to the underworld.
Living souls who ventured too near the tracks as the ghost train made its
nightly sojourn would find themselves swept along -- echoing the Celtic/Germanic
myth of the Wild Hunt, in which witness were compelled to join as either hunter
or prey. Those who thus boarded the train by accident, madness or mere
foolishness were inevitably carried back to whatever eldritch dimension from
whence the train originated. Tales of return voyages are rare and generally held
by those who pass them along to be apocryphal.

A high counter divides the public portion of the library from the reserved
stacks -- all the more esoteric and mysterious volumes from the university's
collection. If anything, the area behind the counter is even more shadowy than
the side you're on. The main reading area lies south.

Hanging on the wall next to the counter is a small, printed sign. Beneath the

Wordlessly the librarian takes the tome from you and spirits it back to the

Library
Shadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps
cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior.
You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a
welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a
small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.

University Court
Isolated and serene within its high, ivy-covered walls, Miskaton University
represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural
achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and
enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further
into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for
its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most
extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer
Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage
and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they
take care of their own.

There are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one
you are interested in is the library to the west.

>se

Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a
country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the
east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make
out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

>e

Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

>n

Local Pub
A dank, drafty old drinking hole lit by flickering, oil-burning lanterns. Smoke
collects in greasy pools among the rafters, and shadows crowd thick around. The
bar runs the length of the room to your right, while to the south a low doorway
opens onto the street.

Mill workers and fishermen occupy a few of the tables, drinking beer or puffing
grimly at long-stemmed pipes. Each is wrapped in his solitude, soaking up the
general miasma of dreary fatalism.

>nw

Twisting Lane
The lane narrows here to little more than a badly cobbled sidewalk as it wends
its way up through a series of tortuous bends and switchbacks. In some places,
the street is so steep that steps have been cut into it, worn down over the
years and slick with moss. Your progress is blocked at the top of the street by
a blank brick wall.

Odd; the wall is no longer blank. Someone has sprayed graffiti across it.

>read wall
It's a strange design done in black spraypaint; an upturned hand with an
irregular triangle inscribed in the palm. Beneath it is drawn an arrow pointing
roughly west, and following it with your gaze, you realize that it points
directly at the narrow aperture of a sidestreet you'd never noticed before.

>w

Hidden Court
You had no idea this little courtyard even existed, cleverly tucked away amidst
the confusing tangle of darker avenues. Although surrounded on all sides by
steep rooftops and overshadowed by the ever-ominous clouds, this secluded circle
somehow manages to convey a sense of peace and brightness, a safe harbor from
the oppressive gloom pervading the rest of the town. To the south, a hanging
sign marks a humble shop, while a sidestreet to the east leads back into the
labyrinth.

>s
A silvery bell jingles as you open the door.

The Cauldron
A warm and pleasantly dim light surrounds you and suffuses this cozy little
shop. The shelves are crammed with every conceivable variety of new age
curiosity: books, crystals, pendants, charms, herbs, potions, incense, candles
and -- sure enough, on a display stand right near the door -- decorative cast-
iron cauldron-shaped paperweights. How cute. In the rear of the store, a lit
display case contains several items of interest. The courtyard lies outside, to
the north.

On the display case is a violin.

The proprietor watches you quietly from behind the display case.

>x violin
It's a gorgeous instrument -- the wood is a rich, polished mahogany, the scroll
and fingerboard gleaming ebony. The strings almost seem to vibrate of their own
accord, as if aching to be played.

>x proprietor
A fabulously thick and bushy tangle of moustache, beard and eyebrows frame the
portly old proprietor's deeply seamed face. His eyes are kind, however, and his
smile warm and ingenuous, and he seems content to watch you quietly with his
hands folded across his considerable paunch as you browse through his shop.

>x case
The display case has a glass front and sliding doors in back that allow the
proprietor to reach inside. Lined up inside it are a deck of tarot cards, a
geode and an amulet. Resting on top of the case is a violin.

>look at cards
A beautiful set of cards in a velvet-lined box. The top card, "The Tower", has
been turned up, allowing you to see the exquisitely detailed artwork. In this
representation, the tower has been painted to resemble a lighthouse, broken by a
bolt of lightning emanating from a great, red-rimmed eye. Two figures, a man and
a woman, tumble from the tower's summit, cast lifelessly into the sea.

>look at geode
A hemisphere of rough, gray stone, about the size and shape of a halved
cantaloupe. Its center is a glittering cavity of violet crystals, thousands of
sparkling, faceted stalactites and stalagmites inside a cave of colored glass.

>look at amulet
It's an unassuming silver pendant hanging from a thin leather thong, fashioned
in the shape of a tiny, upturned hand with a triangle inscribed within the palm.
It reminds you a little of one of those cast pewter game pieces from Monopoly.

>ask proprietor about cards
"Mmm, yes, a rare piece of work. The cards are actually very delicate, thinly
sliced ivory. Almost transparent. The box is walnut." He leans toward you,
offering you a salesman's conspiratorial wink. "They say," he whispers, "that
this very deck was used and endorsed by the infamous medium -- " he frowns. "Not
Blavatski; the other one. What was her name? Anyway, it is said that by shining
a light through the cards and projecting the image onto a wall, you may open
gateways to other worlds. Frankly, I don't buy it."

>ask proprietor about geode
"Nice, isn't it?" beams the proprietor. "I chanced upon it while rock-hunting in
the Cascades last summer."

>ask proprietor about amulet
"Now there's a fancy little thing," remarks the proprietor. "A humble charm
against evil. A ward against the Eye, you might say. Young chap brought that in
some twenty years ago, said he had no more use for superstitious baubles."

The proprietor reaches in through the back of the case and takes out the amulet.
It spins slowly as he holds it up to the light.

"I think, perhaps, that he eventually found different. And I think, perhaps,
that you will, too." He leans forward and, before you can react, slips the
leather thong around your neck. "But you won't make the same mistake, will you,
Miss? No. You go on and keep that, now. My treat. You may find it useful soon."

Your score has just gone up by five points.

>give puzzle box to proprietor

(slipping the newspaper into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
The proprietor takes the puzzle box and turns it over in his hands carefully.
"Now, this is a tricky one," he says. "They don't make them like this anymore.
Frightfully difficult, unless you know the catch of course." His fingers flicker
dexterously over the box, sliding a panel here, pressing a corner in there.
Suddenly the lid pops open with a faint snick.

He places the box on top of the display case. "And there you have it," he says.
"A present for you."

>s

Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is
possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

>s

Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides
by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this
city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to
the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley
Bridge.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking
grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of
some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

>e

Riverwalk
A low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep,
mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access
to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge.
The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The
town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.

>e

Vacant Lot
Where once a building stood, there is now only cracked pavement and rampant
weeds. A high chain-link fence surrounds this vacant lot; the only breaks lie to
the west and southeast.

An old man dressed in dirty rags sits on his mattress, muttering to himself as
he stares intently out to sea.

>x man
This pitiful creature might once have been a successful and healthy man, but
alcohol and mental illness have dragged him down irretrievably into degenerate
squalor. His clothes are filthy tatters; his hair is a matted, knotted mess; his
body reeks of booze and urine. He sits on his mattress, seemingly oblivious to
you or the rest of the world, and that's where he'll stay until either Death or
the next drink comes around.

The old bum is clutching a small object to his chest; he rubs it and turns it in
his hands constantly, as though it were some sort of relic or charm. It's hard
to tell, but it appears to be a key.

"I'm a doctor," the old man mutters to himself. "I was a very good doctor. Don't
tell me about infection. You don't know. You don't know."

>ask man about himself
The old man squints at you with bleary, cunning eyes. "Don't know too much about
that," he quavers. "Memory's not what it used to be... I'm so thirsty, Miss, so
thirsty..."

>give flask to man
(first taking the flask)
(slipping the faculty card into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand
free)
His eyes burning with greed, the old man snatches the flask from your hand,
unscrews the cap and tips it up into his waiting mouth. Trickles of pungent
brown liquid ooze from the corners of his mouth as he swallows convulsively, his
hands trembling, his eyes squeezed shut and streaming tears. Finally, he falls
back onto his mattress with a beatific smile on his mud-smeared face, the flask
dropping from his fingers.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

>ask man about himself
The old man sighs. "I was a doctor, once. I was a very good doctor. But that was
before Edward, you know. Little Edward and his..." His voice trails off to a
whisper, but you could swear he mouthed the word "brother".

>ask man about edward
The old man lets out a vicious cackle. "They got to him, didn't they? Maggots
got to him good. Got into his head. The maggots got into his head, eatin' at him
'til he had to crack it open to get 'em out. Poor boy." He shakes his head.
"Delivered him, I did. Pulled him right out of his mama. Him and his -- "
Suddenly he stops, and will say no more.

>ask man about brother
The old man falls silent all of a sudden, and for a while he simply stares down
at his hands, limp and open in his lap. Then, drawing a deep breath, he begins
to speak, and for the first time his voice is steady, without the reedy whine of
alcoholic craving.

"Ayuh, little Edward had a brother, so he did. And I know him. I know of
William, so I do. I delivered the child. Anna Verlac was his mother. It... it
was... "

He leans over and grips your arm with a hand that is suddenly steady and strong.
"It was her father's poison seed, y'see. That evil bastard poisoned her womb and
put a monster inside her. What she gave birth to... it was... it wasn't... oh,
God, when I held that... that abortion in the shape of an infant, that thing
with hooves for feet and its crown of writhing... when it looked up at me... It
looked up at me with its father's red-rimmed eyes." The old man shudders
convulsively, and it is a while before he can speak again.

"Anna and I decided between ourselves, we did. The... her child... it lived for
a few years, but it was sickly, and in pain, and it could never be normal nor
healthy. She brought it to me... I was her doctor, you see, I'd seen her through
her child's birth, and she trusted me... and I put the thing down, softly and
without pain, and they laid it to rest in the family crypt.

"And Anna thanked me for it, so she did."

The old man falls silent again, and his wavering, bloodshot eyes wander once
more out to sea. And he is lost, once again, to the horror and pain of the
memories that can only be silenced by drink.

>ask man about anna
Tears stream unchecked down the old man's face. "Shouldn't have happened to the
girl. Only seventeen, she was, still a child when he... when that red-eyed
monster took her... " His eyes suddenly darken, his fists clench. "HIS OWN
DAUGHTER, GODS FUCK 'EM! SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER! GODS FUCK
'EM ALL!!"

>ask man about crypt
The old man stares at you suspiciously. "William was buried in the family crypt,
at his mother's request, so he was; what're you getting at?"

>tell man about william
"All I care to tell of that tragedy, I've told," the old man says quietly, not
looking at you. "I've no wish to speak of it again."

>tell man about skull
The old man bares his teeth. "You can't prove it! You can't prove anything, so
you can't!"

>show skull to man
(first taking the animal's skull)
The old man grows sickly pale. He raises one hand, as if to ward off the sight
of the skull, deny the truth one more time; then his hand drops, and he sinks
down onto the mattress, groaning.

"Oh, it's true," he cries, "it's true, God help my lying soul. It was her father
who wished to kill the thing, not Anna -- kill it to make way for another, he
said, a 'more fitting vessel'. He wanted to try again -- Gods, the depth of his
evil -- after the way the first one came out, he wanted to try again!

"Anna came to me and asked for my help, and what could I do? What could I do? It
was her child, for God's sake, no matter what else it was, and she couldn't bear
to lose it. But we had to weigh the coffin down with something..."

He sits up, suddenly, fastening on you with a sick, pleading look.

"I've told you too much, now," he whispers desperately. "They'll know; the
maggots'll find out for sure. They'll find me; even in my hole, they'll find
me." He lets out an eye-wateringly pungent breath, "P'raps it's best they do.
I've spent so long drowning my sins, p'raps time's come to pay for them at last.
This won't do me much good no more," he says, holding up his little copper key.
"And yet..." He closes his fist around it again. "And yet, maybe there's a
way... they say there's ways to protect yourself, wards versus the Evil Eye and
such. " The old man stares greedily at the amulet around your neck. "Perhaps, if
I could get me one o' those..."

>give amulet to man
"Thank you kindly, Miss, you're a generous one, so you are," grins the old man
as he closes his grimy fingers around the charm. "And here y'are," he says,
tossing you the copper key. "I'll pray it does you good."

The old man staggers to his feet. "I'll be gettin' on, then," he says. "If I can
make away before nightfall, p'raps I'll be out of their reach before the maggots
come out." He wraps the leather thong around his hand and closes the charm in
his fist.

He turns to you one last time. "Don't let them find you," he says earnestly.
"Get out while you can. If you stay, they'll track you down eventually. It's the
blood. He can smell it, so he can. And he always returns to his blood."

He shambles off, up the riverwalk toward Town Square, his shadow dragging long
behind him. Looking to the sky, you realize that the sun is nearly set; you've
been talking to the old man for much longer than you thought, and it will be
dark soon.

The gentle creaking of hawsers and the hollow slap of water beneath the wooden
pier provide a faint counterpoint to the endless, rhythmic surging of the sea.
The fishing industry (like the paper industry) has all but died away in
Anchorhead; nonetheless there are still a few boats tied to the pier. A path
leads back through an opening in a chain-link fence to the northwest; otherwise,

Chilly Avenue
Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky
waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems
perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads
lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.

>sw
The ground begins to rise sharply as the road climbs up into the hills south of
town.

Scenic View
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in
the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the
grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the
paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding
ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east.
Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost
directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just
make out the shape of the obelisk from here.

Outside the House
The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by
gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of
your house, which lies north.

The front door stands open to the north.

The Verlac mansion looms before you, casting an air of menace over the clearing.

A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.

Foyer
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels
cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high.
The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows,
and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not
a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and
timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

The front door stands open to the south.

Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.

You call out to let Michael know you're home, but no one answers. The house is
still, hushed; an eery prickling walks up your back like centipede legs. Michael
isn't here, you realize. The house is empty. You are alone.

There is a cord dangling in mid-air here, right about level with your face.

Library
Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to
shun the printed word. Books line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark-
paneled, green-carpeted room, interrupted only by doorways to the east and
south. A rich, brown leather armchair sits in stately repose near the window,
with a polished brass pipe stand nearby completing the picture of some blue-
blooded country squire's literary refuge. Once again, you are struck by how
easily this place could have been the perfect home.

A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors stand closed to the east.

You can also see a cardboard box (in which are some newspaper clippings) here.

Study
This smaller room adjoining the library seems comfortable enough, although it is
dusty and cluttered from having not been lived in for the better part of a year.
Aside from the desk and the chair and the empty shelves, the only real feature
of the room is the large, ornate fireplace in the southern wall.

A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors lead west, to the library.

symbol for the writer who wants to look as though he might stop whatever he's
doing at the drop of a hat and suddenly hack out a bestseller. While you have
yet to witness Michael do this, he really had been wanting one since before the
two of you even met; so, to celebrate his new teaching position, you splurged
and bought him one.

The laptop is currently switched on.

The computer is in screen-saver mode: blank except for a single window
requesting a 4-digit user passcode. Odd; you didn't think Michael ever used the
passcode utility.

The passcode window disappears and the screen suddenly fills with text,
apparently the last thing Michael was working on before he got up and left.

Michael has evidently been writing something, but it's not a story; it looks
more like some kind of journal entry.

I cannot sleep.

Or perhaps I should say: I must not sleep, since I am perfectly capable of sleep
-- in fact, lately sleep has come to me more easily, more quickly, and more
insidiously than it ever has before. But I don't want to sleep.

I have been hoping that the terrible dreams would prove to be stress-related,
that they would fade once the move was behind us and we had finally settled in
-- but that has not turned out to be the case. They're stronger than ever. Red-
rimmed eyes pursuing me through strange corridors, and the voice -- the
whisperer who tells me I am not who I am. The whisperer tells me secrets of this
house, secrets of those who lived here -- they are my blood, and he tells me he
always returns to his blood. He tells me of secret keys and combinations; I
don't know what they open yet but I have an idea --

Tomorrow I must go down to the cellar. I must see if the things revealed to me
in that terrible book are true.

I know she is worried about me. I want to tell her, but --

The entry ends there, unfinished.

Library
Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to
shun the printed word. Books line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark-
paneled, green-carpeted room, interrupted only by doorways to the east and
south. A rich, brown leather armchair sits in stately repose near the window,
with a polished brass pipe stand nearby completing the picture of some blue-
blooded country squire's literary refuge. Once again, you are struck by how
easily this place could have been the perfect home.

A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors lead east, to the study.

The shuttered window at the end of the hall throws a gloomy rectangle of light

It's much cooler up here than in the rest of the house, and you find it hard to
suppress a shiver. Grotesque, looming shadows crawl across the low, slanted
ceiling, and the dust hangs thick and motionless in the air. To the west the

crawl, while to the north stands a wooden door, draped in shadows and half-
hidden by the slanting eaves.

It's an ordinary wooden door, unremarkable except for the antique metal

Attic Cell
A cramped little annex off the main attic, with a tiny, shuttered window high up
on the north wall. A pile of mouldering straw in the corner and what looks like
pencil marks on the lower part of the walls seem to indicate that someone lived
here once. Or, possibly, was kept here.

This disgusting mess might actually have been some poor soul's bed. You shudder,
wondering what sick relative was kept prisoner here, and when.

You gingerly poke through the filthy straw, barely able to suppress your

the pile, you discover a tiny gold locket.

From the quality of the photograph, you'd say the picture must have been taken
sometime in the fifties. The woman looks no more than twenty years old. Her
pale, fragile face is framed by straight, dark, mousy hair, and she seems to
stare plaintively out at you, her expression one of haunted resignation.

Gratefully, you leave your things on the bedroom floor, crawl into bed and pull
the covers up to your chin.

>sleep
You lie awake for what seems like hours, listening to the house creak and settle
around you and wondering where your husband is. You try to convince yourself
that he merely went for a walk and lost track of the time, as he is so often
wont to do. In any case, with no telephone and no car, there is little you can
do besides hope that he will turn up in the morning. With your worried thoughts
chasing themselves endlessly around your mind, you eventually drift off into an
uneasy sleep...







Down the road and through the woods, where the whippoorwills call their
lunatic's song, you are running. The sky boils and thunders overhead. The red-
rimmed eyes glare down at you. When you look up at them, they merge together,
melting into a single, baleful orb -- a swollen, bloody moon.

You must escape. You veer off the road, tripping over an old, rotted stump,
pushing aside a twisted sapling. Vines and brambles tear at your clothes. Rocks
cut your feet. But still you must run, until you suddenly burst out of the
underbrush, into a tangled, moonlit clearing.

An ancient, flagstone well stands amidst the weeds in the clearing's center, and
you are drawn to it. Something is moving inside, scratching at the stones down
in that circle of blackness, and for some reason all you can think is the
basement, Michael is in the basement, and he's doing something bad...

Heart hammering, you lean over the crumbling lip. Your hair slips from your
shoulders, dangling tantalizingly close to the well's opening...

... the whippoorwills reach a crescendo...

Your eyes adjust to the dark and you see --

-- you see the most horrible thing --[              * THE THIRD DAY *

with the sheets wrapped in a twisted snarl around his body.

Michael is sprawled across the bed with the sheets tangled around his legs,
oblivious to the world. Usually, Michael is a light sleeper; you've never seen
him so thoroughly knocked out before.

are stuck to his skin as well.

You try to get dressed as quietly as possible, but apparently Michael isn't as
knocked out as you thought he was. Michael comes awake with a jerk and a hoarse
shout. For a moment or two he only stares about blindly, as if unsure of where
he is and all but unaware of your presence. Then, with a grunt of surprise, he
seems to come to his senses and painstakingly crawls out of bed.

Michael stops and looks down at his feet. For a moment he looks genuinely
dumbfounded. "I... I, uh... I don't know. I have no idea how that got there."

He spreads his hands and looks the other way. Suddenly you realize: he is
frightened. He is hiding something from you, certainly, but he's hiding it
because he is frightened of it. Maybe he doesn't himself understand what
happened to him last night... or where it happened to him.

somewhere others have died. The foyer lies west, and a doorway to the left of

Standing on tiptoe and placing your eye up to the hole, you see the children's
bedroom. Through some strange trick of the angle, you appear to be looking
straight down at the bed from the middle of the ceiling.

Suddenly Michael walks into the bedroom. He moves slowly, looking around and
lightly touching things, as if visiting old memories. He walks over to the crib
and spends some minutes staring down into its empty blankets, after which he
sighs. Then he turns and adjusts the coverlet on the child's bed.

He walks over to the vanity and picks up the jewelry box. Carefully, he opens it
and, finding it empty, sets it down again with a soft curse. He looks around the
room suspiciously, as if expecting to find the culprit hiding in a corner
somewhere. For a moment Michael simply stands there aimlessly, compulsively
rubbing his forehead; then he stalks out of the room and is gone.

Suddenly you hear a deep grinding noise that seems to vibrate up through the
floor from beneath the house. A moment later there is a terrible, wailing howl
as of some subterranean wind shrieking through unlit passages. Then the grinding

Timidly, you call out Michael's name. There is no answer. You are alone in the

Observatory
You are in a small, enclosed cupola situated, by the look of the view through
the dingy skylight over your head, on top of the roof of the house. The walls
are covered with astrological and astronomical charts with equations and
diagrams scribbled across them in crabbed, stilted handwriting. The only exit
seems to be an oddly-angled corridor to the southeast.

Dominating the center of the room is a large mounted telescope, pointed almost
straight up through the skylight.

Constructed of some greenish metal, the telescope consists in the main of an

Observatory
You are in a small, enclosed cupola situated, by the look of the view through
the dingy skylight over your head, on top of the roof of the house. The walls
are covered with astrological and astronomical charts with equations and
diagrams scribbled across them in crabbed, stilted handwriting. The only exit
seems to be an oddly-angled corridor to the southeast.

Dominating the center of the room is a large mounted telescope, pointed almost
straight up through the skylight.

>x puzzle box
It's roughly the size and shape of a cigar box, carved from some dark and oddly
streaked wood that you can't identify. All six surfaces are decorated in a
complex arrangement of grooves and panels, most of which are illustrated with
leering, demonic faces and obscene designs. The box is open, the top folded back
on itself to reveal a strange black disk.

>x disk
It's a dark, glassy circle, about the width of your hand in diameter and half an
inch thick in the middle, tapering off to thinness toward the edge like a convex
lens. Its color is the deep, oily black of obsidian, though you fancy you can
see faint swirls of color inside it like the rainbow sheen of oil on water. Its
curved surface is cool and perfectly smooth. Although incredibly hard, the
material does not feel like stone; there is an odd, yielding quality to it,
almost like something organic... almost, you realize with disquiet, like skin.

Dear Christ.

Dear Christ, you can see it.

The comet, roaring silently through the endless void, streaking toward Earth,
and it's alive, this thing that is coming is ALIVE, tendrils that must be
hundreds, thousands of miles long streaming before it, reaching out to grasp and
strangle and devour whole worlds, and it is coming here, it is coming to Earth,
and its great, lidless, red-rimmed eye rolls over in a vast lake of vitreous
fluid, and it

looks

at

you









































...you wake up some time later, shaking your head. You're not sure what,
exactly, you just witnessed; whether it was a genuine astronomical phenomenon,
or a hallucination, or the actual form of some Dark God from the Outer Reaches,
come to devour the world. You're not even entirely sure you remember what it
looked like. The only thing you can clearly recall is a single name, pulsing in
your brain like a bruise:

"Ialdabaoloth".

As you make your way down the corridor, you begin to get dizzy, then nauseous.

Crawlspace
The ceiling descends here to no more than three feet from the floor; you are

Attic
It's much cooler up here than in the rest of the house, and you find it hard to
suppress a shiver. Grotesque, looming shadows crawl across the low, slanted
ceiling, and the dust hangs thick and motionless in the air. To the west the
ceiling dips even lower until the space beneath leaves hardly room enough to
crawl, while to the north stands a wooden door, draped in shadows and half-
hidden by the slanting eaves.

This must be the children's bedroom. The bed is smaller than the one in the

Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to

with a polished brass pipe stand nearby completing the picture of some blue-

This smaller room adjoining the library seems comfortable enough, although it is

The cellar door stands open, revealing dark stairs leading down.

>d
You descend the gloomy steps into the dank cellar.

Cellar
The old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the
sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons
the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar
extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a
hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.

One largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the
far wall.

>e

Wine Cellar
This wing of the cellar is even older than the rest, with walls of piled,
unmortared stone. The entire room is filled with wine racks. They cover every
wall except for one spot to the west, where an exit leads back to the main
cellar.

All of the racks are dust-covered and empty except for one against the north
wall, which contains some forty or fifty dark bottles.

You are reminded of something Michael told you during the long drive up: about
how when the police arrived after the shooting, they found the wine cellar in a
shambles -- nearly every bottle thrown to the floor and shattered, and the whole
place reeking of rotted grapes. All except the bottles in the north rack. None
of those had been touched. No one could posit a motive for it.

You smile a bit, recalling your husband's ability to turn a piece of
insignificant trivia into a compelling story. Still, though, now that you're
actually standing here... it all seems very strange.

>x racks
These racks must have at one time contained hundreds upon hundreds of wine
bottles. Idly, you wonder which member of the family developed such a taste for
what would have been, for the first few generations at least, a sinful vice of
the basest kind.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

You take a few cautious steps into the corridor, when the wall suddenly slams
shut behind you with a reverberating boom. You are trapped!

Windy Passage
The walls of this passageway are carved from solid rock with unearthly
precision; ten feet wide, ten feet high, perfectly smooth and perfectly square.
The passage runs north, sloping downward into the depths of the hillside. A foul
wind gusts intermittently from the darkness below.

>n

Edge of the Pit
The passageway ends here at a fathomless pit, a puckered circular hole in the
rock from which the foul wind seems to emanate, howling up from the depths like
a reeking banshee.

A thin and decrepit rope bridge spans the pit, shivering occasionally in the
wind.

Another blast of hot, foul-smelling air comes shrieking out of the pit.

>n
Carefully, you edge out onto the swaying planks. The ropes creak ominously as
you cross. A couple of the tattered lines snap just as you reach the halfway
mark, and the bridge lists sharply to the left. A few more steps, however, and
you are safely on the other side.

Other Side
The passageway turns east here, the stone floor dropping down in a series of
wide steps carved into the living rock. The stairs continue down to the
northeast, eventually curving out of sight. The only other way on from here is a
narrow, oddly-angled corridor in the northwest corner.

Bottom of Stairs
The stairs end here at a huge, greenish-gold door set into the north wall. There
is nothing else here; nowhere to go but onward or back.

>x door
The door is enormous, nearly fifteen feet on a side, and made entirely of some
smooth, greenish-gold metal that reflects your light with an oily, wavery sheen.
There is no handle, no keyhole or latch of any kind. There seems to be no
physical way of opening the door at all -- just the smooth rectangle of metal,
adorned with a single symbol etched into its center.

>say ialdabaoloth
The metallic door suddenly rings out as if struck; it vibrates in aching harmony
with the blasphemous name -- a shrill, grating sound like a dentist's drill. The
air grows thick and terrible shapes waver and melt in the air before you --
shapes that twitch and move with hungry purpose, and seem to look at you -- and
then the ringing fades away. There is a moment of stillness, and then the
gleaming door swings smoothly open on perfectly balanced and utterly silent
hinges.

>n
The doorway opens out into a large, dome-ceilinged cavern. You stand at the
threshold for a moment, peering into the strange, phosphorescent gloom, before
your eyes can make out enough details to see what this place is; even then, it
is almost a full minute before your mind can accept what you are seeing...

Burial Mound
The cave is lined, floor to ceiling, with mummified human corpses. Shrunken and
desiccated, they lie in jumbled heaps inside irregularly carved niches. Carvings
cover the rock walls in between the niches -- grotesque, leering faces too
horrible even to look upon, their features twitching and smirking in the
wavering light that sifts down from above.

And dominating the center of the chamber: a dark monolith rising up through the
green, murky light -- what you first took to be a large, supporting pillar, you
now realize can only be the true base of the town square obelisk.

At the narrower, northern end of the vaguely egg-shaped cavern sits a massive
stone altar, flanked on either side by a pair of strange, vibrating columns.

The flute emits an odd mixture of metallic, warbling notes which intertwine and
harmonize eerily with each other.

The strange harmony of the flute blends with the atonal ringing of the two
columns, and the three sounds suddenly grow stronger, resonating with and
reinforcing one another, intertwining like a dissonant, invisible braid. The
sound increases in volume, piercing your eardrums and causing the very air to
shimmer.

Suddenly the air above the altar begins to ripple as though with extreme heat.
The very fabric of space seems to twist and buckle between the two columns; and
then, with a sound like a wet sheet being torn slowly down the middle, the
fabric splits.

You are immediately swept off your feet by a powerful sucking vacuum, pulling
everything within reach toward the portal. Dust and debris; bones and loose rock
from the burial niches; everything not nailed down goes flying across the temple
and into the all-devouring maw hovering over the altar-stone. Desperately, you
wedge your fingers into a crack in the floor and hang on for dear life as the
wind tries to claw you away. You scream, and even the sound of your voice is
whipped away, pulled over your shoulder like a trailing ribbon and sucked into
whatever blasphemous dimension lies beyond that horrible rift.

For a few agonizing moments you don't think you're going to make it; then,
suddenly, the chaos stops, leaving you breathless on the floor.

Painstakingly, you pry your stiff, bleeding fingers out of the crack and roll
over. The rift is gone. The air is normal, and the columns are ringing quietly,
as if nothing had happened.

becomes the ceiling. Half-blind, unsure even of which direction you were going
in, you stagger forward and suddenly find yourself in a...

Crawlspace
The ceiling descends here to no more than three feet from the floor; you are
forced to crawl through the cramped darkness on your hands and knees. To the
east the attic becomes more spacious, while the northwest corner opens into an
oddly-angled corridor.

>e

Attic
It's much cooler up here than in the rest of the house, and you find it hard to
suppress a shiver. Grotesque, looming shadows crawl across the low, slanted
ceiling, and the dust hangs thick and motionless in the air. To the west the
ceiling dips even lower until the space beneath leaves hardly room enough to
crawl, while to the north stands a wooden door, draped in shadows and half-
hidden by the slanting eaves.

>d
The ancient rungs creak alarmingly as you descend.

Upstairs Hall
The shuttered window at the end of the hall throws a gloomy rectangle of light
onto the bare wooden floor. Doorways lead north and south.

A rickety wooden ladder stands here, descending from a three-foot by three-foot
square of darkness in the ceiling.

>w

Upstairs Landing
A narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the
house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.

>d

Foyer
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels
cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high.
The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows,
and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not
a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and
timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.

Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.

>xyzzy
That's not a verb I recognise.

>s
(opening the front door first)

Outside the House
The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by
gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of
your house, which lies north.

The front door stands open to the north.

The Verlac mansion looms before you, casting an air of menace over the clearing.

A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.

The hairs on the back of your neck prickle as you step outside. Something is
wrong. Something is very wrong with the air. A heavy, charged sensation, like
standing next to high-tension wires; a faint odor of spoiled meat drifting on
the wind; you can't put your finger on it, but it might have something to do
with that strange hole in the sky.

>se

Scenic View
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in
the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the
grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the
paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding
ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east.
Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost
directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just
make out the shape of the obelisk from here.

>ne

Chilly Avenue
Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky
waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems
perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads
lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.

>s

Deserted Lane
The gently winding lane makes its way through the birch woods south of town. New
England foliage is famous for its splendid colors in the fall, but the
oppressive weather and pervading murk have leached these trees of most of their
tint. The road continues south into the increasingly dense forest, and in the
other direction heads back to town. A paved walk also leads east through the
trees.

>s

Down the Road
The forest grows denser as you go, crowding thickly up to either side of the
road. The groping, tangled branches block out what little sunlight there is
left. Your footsteps are muffled; whispering leaves and the slow drip of water
are the only sounds you can hear. Beyond the watching trees, the shadows are
impenetrably thick. The road stretches interminably, north to south.

There's something strangely familiar about the woods here... scenes from last
night's dream flicker through your memory, but you are unable to recall the
details.

>look at woods
You scrutinize the edge of the road carefully, looking for whatever it was you
saw...

There. On the west side. That stump, and the twisted sapling growing next to it;
you recognize them. And just beyond them... the path. It's the path you took in
your dream, a narrow rut running west through the underbrush. You can hardly
believe it, but there it is.

>x stump
It's the rotted stump of a tree that must have fallen long ago. It's
unremarkable, almost completely buried by the underbrush; the only reason you
even noticed it is because of your dream.

A gust of wind blows your hair into your face.

>x path
You can't see any such thing.

>x sapling
A bent and stunted sapling, barely taller than you are, grows from the mulchy
ground around the rotting stump. It's a perfectly ordinary-looking sapling, just
like many others you've spotted growing here in and there among the trees --
except that this one was in your dream.

>w

Trampled Path
The tangled undergrowth has been beaten down in a path leading roughly from the
east to the southwest. Shrubs and grass have been flattened and pushed aside,
vines torn down, and small trees bent or even snapped in half, as though
something heavy with huge, flat feet had simply trampled its way through.

>sw

Abandoned Slaughterhouse
The decayed remains of an old slaughterhouse stand here, now little more than a
shell of crumbling brick and gaping holes, surrounded by a clearing of yellow,
sickly grass. A path leads northeast, back toward the road; to the west, a
gaping hole that might once have been a doorway leads into the rotting building.

The forest is unnaturally quiet here, you notice; there are no birds calling, no
leaves rustling or branches creaking; even the whippoorwills have fallen silent.
All is still, holding its collective breath in an expectant hush.

>save
Ok.

>x house
It's an ordinary-looking key. The word "house" is written on a tiny piece of
tape affixed to the key's tab.

>x slaughterhouse
The ancient walls are barely even holding themselves together. The only reason
you can tell it used to be a slaughterhouse is the faded paint on one wall:
"Crompton Meat Processing".

>w

Crumbled Ruin
The roof has collapsed, leaving the interior open to the sky; the floor is
nothing but bare, beaten dirt. Gaps in the bricks lead east and south. Although
nothing stands now but the tottering, crumbling stonework (and that only
barely), you fancy you can still detect a faint miasma of death -- a palpable,
chilling reminder of the bloody work which once went on within these walls.

There's something odd about the ground here; some faint marking or pattern.

An old rusty meat hook sticks out of the ground nearby, its point half-buried in
the dirt.

Over in the far corner, a tattered sheet of drawing paper lies discarded on the
ground.

>get hook
You pick up the meat hook. The crossbar fits in your palm, leaving the hook part
to stick out between the third and fourth fingers. It's a heavy sucker, nearly
fifteen inches long from handle to point, made for hauling around carcasses with
a minimum of ceremony. You wouldn't like to think what this could do to a living
person.

It's the "Weekly Arkham Herald". Anchorhead, apparently, is not large enough to
warrant its own newspaper.

The drawing is of a pair of crudely rendered figures, scrawled with dark, heavy
lines that occasionally punch right through the paper. The two figures are
holding hands. The one on the left is a smiling woman with long, straight hair;
the one on the right...

Well, you don't know. Frankly, you'd rather not speculate. An octopus on human
legs, maybe, if you could believe any healthy child would conceive of such a
thing. Above the first figure is scribbled the word "MOMY"; above the second,
"WILAM (ME)".

Old Stone Well
Beyond the south wall of the old slaughterhouse, there is nothing but a tangled
thicket so dense as to be impenetrable in every direction except to the north,
where you can slip back into the ruined slaughterhouse through a hole in the
wall.

Rising from the midst of the underbrush is a squat circle of stone: the top of
an ancient well. A circle of rotting plywood covers the opening.

>x well
It's built of mortared stone, and comes about to the level of your waist. The
top of the well is covered by a circle of rotting plywood.

>x cover
Which do you mean, the wooden cover or the family album?

>wooden cover
Nothing but a thick sheet of plywood cut into a rough circle, about a yard
across.

A flurry of dead leaves goes skittering along the ground, swirling past you in
the wind.

>move wooden cover
You dig your fingers under the edge of the plywood and, straining as hard as you
can, manage to slide the heavy cover off the top of the well and onto the grass.

>look down
You see nothing special at your feet.

>look into well
The well is very deep, although the rough stonework would probably allow you to
safely climb down. Its depths are too shadowy for you to make out any details at
the bottom.

>d
Carefully testing each foothold, you descend into the well.

In the Well
The sky is a dim circle of light far above you. The stone walls press in on you
from all sides, and the air is clammy and frigid. A faint odor of decay drifts
up from the floor; the smell of a trapped animal decomposing under the back
porch.

You are standing knee deep in a rattling jumble of children's bones.

>x bones
You can deduce only two things about the gruesome pile: there are more bones
here than could be produced by a single child, and some of the bones are older
than others. Whoever has been throwing them down here has been doing it for a
long time.

>search bones
You notice a tuft of brown among the yellowed-ivory of the bones. Moving aside a
clattering pile of ribs, you discover a child's teddy bear.

>get bear
You pick up the teddy bear. It is old and threadbare, its fur worn through to
the stuffing in some places. Stitched onto its behind is the name "Jeffrey".

The marks in the dirt are tracks of some kind, but not of any animal you're

The prints are large -- quite a bit larger than your outspread hand, and vaguely
round. They criss-cross the ground in every direction. Whatever made them
obviously lives here, or at least visits quite often.

>e
You are about to step back through the eastern wall when a noise makes you stop.
In the woods outside, to the east -- something is there. Something breathing.
Something huge.

A branch cracks sharply; and another. It's coming this way.

The sound of tearing undergrowth grows louder. Whatever it is, it's practically

As quickly as you are able, you scramble down the rough stone walls. Ten feet
from the bottom, you slip, landing with a clatter amidst the dusty bones.

The sky is a dim circle of light far above you. The stone walls press in on you
from all sides, and the air is clammy and frigid. A faint odor of decay drifts

You are standing knee deep in a rattling jumble of children's bones.

The ground trembles slightly with the thing's thunderous footsteps as it tromps
up the path. It's right outside the slaughterhouse!

>hide under bones
You burrow down into the bones, piling more bones on top of you for cover while
trying to make as little noise as possible.

You hear it pause inside the building, its hide slithering loudly against the
brick walls as it moves about. There is a horrible, wet snorting sound, as if it
were trying to pick up a scent, then an unspeakable, inhuman grunt of anger.

>listen
You hear nothing unexpected.

Scarcely daring to breathe, you lie as still as possible beneath your cover of
bones as the thing, whatever it is, moves closer. A shadow falls across the
mouth of the well, and then the circle of light above you is blotted out by a
shape so utterly, blasphemously hideous that it is all you can do to remain
conscious. Two grotesquely blue and childlike eyes blink down into the darkness
of the well, searching...






And then it is gone.

You must have lost consciousness after all, judging from the stiffness in your
limbs and the difference in the light. You have no idea how long you were out,
but the creature must have passed you by. The forest is still again; the
breathing and footsteps, gone.

Involuntarily, you let out a long, shuddering breath.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

The bones fall away, clattering loudly as you stand up.

other direction heads back to town. A paved walk also leads east through the
trees.

A small group of townsfolk has gathered up at the north end of the road. As you
approach, still breathless from your encounter with the thing at the
slaughterhouse, they turn toward you -- and that's when you notice that the one
in the lead has an axe in his hand. And the one behind him has a pair of garden
shears.

A couple of men move over to your left, and several more step out of the forest
behind you. All of them carry weapons or nasty farm implements of some kind, and
all of them look as though they're just about ready to put an end to a certain
over-curious, outsider woman who doesn't know enough to keep her nose out of
things better left undisturbed.

>e
You dart past the men on your right, making a break for the church. The
townsfolk hover around the entrance to the churchyard but do not follow you,
confident that there is no way you can escape.

Churchyard
A low, wrought-iron fence, its spike-tipped bars bent or leaning at crazy
angles, surrounds the overgrown yard of this dark, abandoned church. A gap in

leads around the church to the southeast.

As you drop to the floor, the trap door suddenly slams shut above you. You hear

drift away.

Church Cellar
Centipedes and beetles scurry away across the rotten floorboards as you shine
your light across the room. Over in the corner sits a hulking shape of black
metal that was probably once a wood-burning furnace; aside from that, the cellar
looks empty. A dark alcove, the shadows within too thick to see through, opens

At least a dozen sturdy boards have been nailed across the sturdy oak doors;

Chapel
Broken shards from the shattered the stained glass windows grits under your feet
as you step around rows of overturned pews. The dust and cobwebs have been busy
here, reclaiming another bit of this town's abandoned history. To the west lies
the vestibule; to the east, a small doorway behind the pulpit leads to the back
of the church.

The big wooden cross that once hung above the pulpit has fallen, split in half.

On the pulpit is a huge, black tome.

>x cross
From the way it fell, it looks as though it must have been hung upside-down.

>x windows
The stained-glass windows are old and coated with grime, and many of the panels
have been broken out by time and vandals. Enough remains for you to make out
most of the designs depicted in them, however -- and you find them vaguely
disturbing. Saints -- at least none of the saints you're aware of -- should not
be depicted performing such acts, nor with such insidious leers on their faces
as they perform them.

>x tome
It lies open atop the pulpit, thicker than an unabridged dictionary. Its
thousands of yellowed, crinkly pages are bound in a strange black material that
looks like some kind of hide but clearly isn't leather. Your first thought was
that it might be a Bible, but a glance is sufficient to tell you otherwise. The
text within is arranged in two columns, the first in what looks like Latin, the
second a translation in English. There are illustrations, as well: horrible
icons that make your skin crawl to look at.

>save
Ok.

>read tome
As you lean closer over the pages to make out the words in this dim light, the
letters seem to writhe and crawl across the page, twisting themselves into
strange combinations, horrible words that you've never read before... and yet,
somehow, you can understand their repulsive meaning. Something about a "Blessed
Event",  which will happen very soon, and a hideous god whose name may not be
spoken...

Is this the book that was preached in this church before it fell to ruin? Are
these the gods these people worshipped? You want to tear your eyes from the page
in revulsion, but some small, gleefully filthy part of you wants to keep
reading, to uncover the secrets that the people of Anchorhead uncovered...

Will you read on?

>yes
As your hungry eyes lap up word after blasphemous word, it all becomes clear to
you: you come to understand the true nature of He Who Is Named Not, and what the
Verlacs were trying to accomplish all these years, preparing the people of
Anchorhead for the Blessed Event... it all makes sense to you now.

You step back, smiling, from the podium. There's no need to be afraid, you
realize, for neither yourself nor your husband are in any danger. It's all
right. It all makes sense. And when you raise your hands to your face and slowly
push the fingernails of your first and middle fingers into each eye, digging the
soft, bloody tissue out and dragging it down your cheeks in ropy smears... why,
that's all right, too.

It's the most natural thing in the world.

This little room behind the chapel is hardly bigger than a broom closet. A

Steeple
A tiny space inside the tip of the church's steeple, barely five feet across,
the walls tapering to only two feet across some twelve feet above your head.
There is a narrow window, but it seems to have been painted black at some point.
The only exit seems to be the ladder from which you just emerged.

An old length of rope dangles down from a square hole cut in the ceiling.

>x rope
It's about twenty feet long, frayed in a few places but still sturdy enough.

You haul yourself up onto the rope, bringing your whole weight to bear. It holds

muffled clank. The rope falls, spilling you to the floor amidst an untidy tangle

A dim antechamber, opening onto the main chapel to the east. To the west, the

The stairs are completely gone, now. All that's left is a narrow ledge
overlooking an empty shaft, and a fair portion of the railing still nailed to
the wall.

>save

The hooded robe drops down out of sight, and a few seconds later you hear a

>tie rope to railing
You tie the rope securely to the railing, letting the other end dangle down into
the dark shaft.

>down
Gripping the end of the rope tightly, you lower yourself off the edge and shimmy
down into the darkness.

Hanging From the Rope
Your feet dangle over empty space. Looking down, you can barely make out a faint
glimmer of water, far below.

>drop rope
You take a deep breath, shut your eyes tight, say a quick prayer... and let go
of the rope.

The heart-stopping plunge lasts only a second or two before you hit shockingly
cold water. Your flashlight goes out and blackness envelopes you. Water rushes
into your mouth and nose; the stone bottom slams into your side and nearly
knocks the wind out of you... and then you find your feet, and your head breaks
the surface. Blindly, you thrash about until you find higher ground, and you
crawl, choking and sputtering, feeling cold brick beneath your fingers.

Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

>turn on flashlight
The flashlight must not be quite as waterproof as you originally thought; the
beam flickers unsteadily, and you have to bang it against the palm of your hand
a couple of times to get it to work.

Vaulted Tunnel
The walls of this long, rectangular chamber are made of crumbling brick, not
concrete; most likely it was built at some earlier period than the rest of the
tunnels. The ceiling is lost in darkness above you, but from the sounds of the
echoes it must be pretty high. Water flowing in from the northwestern tunnel has
pooled in a depression sunk into the limestone floor, becoming quite deep near
the far end.

The shattered wreckage of the church stairway lies half submerged in the water-
filled depression. You're lucky to have missed it in your fall.

You can also see a hooded robe here.

>get robe

>nw

Sewer Tunnel
The tunnel is ankle-deep in brackish water, though raised walkways on either
side provide relatively dry footing. The walls are slick, the air damp and foul.
The main tunnel runs north and southeast. Numerous smaller pipelines lead in all
directions, but all are too small for you to crawl through. Iron rungs embedded
in the wall lead up through an access shaft, back to the surface.

>n

Dripping Tunnel
The ceiling in this north-south tunnel is so low you must bend nearly double to
navigate it. Water drips endlessly through the walls and ceiling, seeping in
through thousands of invisible fissures, the constant plip-plip-plipping echoing
loudly throughout the tunnel. The air is so damp you can hardly breathe. Unless
your sense of direction is mistaken, you must be crossing the Miskaton River --
underneath it.

>n

Broken Tunnel
This looks to be an older part of the sewer system that has fallen into
disrepair. Many of the pipes here have crumbled and are filled with debris.

Set in the low ceiling is an old iron hatch.

>x hatch
It's a rectangle of corroded metal, just over a foot long on each side. There
are hinges along one edge on this side; if you could get your fingers under the
opposite edge, you could probably pry it open.

>open hatch
You dig your fingers under the edge and tug, but the hinges are rusted nearly
solid. You can't make it budge.

>open tin

You open the old tin, revealing a smelly quantity of fish oil.

>put oil on hatch

You dip your finger in and come up with a small glob of pungent fish oil.

You rub a good amount of fish oil all over the rusty hinges.

>close tin
You close the old tin.

The flashlight beam flickers uncertainly for a moment, then comes back a bit
weaker than before.

>open hatch
The oiled hinges give a little, allowing you to wiggle your fingers further
under the door's edge. A sharp tug -- and the door swings down suddenly,
spilling filthy water into your face.

>u

Outflow Tunnel
From the smell of it, this must be a sewage outflow tunnel. Filthy water swirls
past a metal grate to the west and eddies around your hands and knees, on which
you are forced to crawl in this cramped cylindrical passageway. To the east, the
tunnel narrows still further, terminating about twenty feet further in a circle
of dim light.
Much of the water is pouring through an open hatch set in the floor of the
tunnel.

>e
You reach the end of the pipe and wriggle your way out, dropping awkwardly to
the sand.

Narrow Beach
This narrow strip of beach is tucked away between two outcroppings in the
predominantly rocky shoreline, accessible only from a steep, muddy slope to the
west. The sand is filthy and strewn with rocks, seaweed, litter and other bits
of storm-tossed detritus.

Near the bottom of the slope, a sewage outflow pipe juts out over the beach,
about three feet above the ground. A thin stream of acrid-smelling sewer water
trickles out over the lip of the pipe, forming a puddle in the sand.

>turn off flashlight
You switch the flashlight off.

>w
You pick your way up the slope, push the loose board aside and slip back in
through the gap.

Alley
This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of
rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick
walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a
tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style
window. One of the garbage cans has been pushed up against the wall directly
underneath it.

Outside the Real Estate Office
A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office,
which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the
west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

The office door is open.

Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted,
papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and

>read hastily written letter
The letter reads:

"To whom it may concern --

"My name is Claudia Benson, and I attest that I am of sound mind and body, at
least for what little time I have left.

"If you are reading this anywhere within the city limits of Anchorhead, be aware
that your life is in grave and immediate danger. Nearly all of the inhabitants
of this city are members of a secret cult that has thrived since before the
first settlers arrived here in the early 1600s and is still strong today. Its
members are fanatical and quite insane, and will kill anyone who learns their
secrets. I received a phone call early this morning which I believe is a threat
to my life; I assume the cult somehow discovered that I was planning to divulge
information to an outsider and now plans to silence me. In case I don't make it,
I am leaving this testimony for someone to find; hopefully it will be someone
who can put a stop to this madness once and for all.

"The cult originally evolved from the rituals of the ancient Misquat Indian
tribe that once lived in this region. Although this tribe is now extinct, its
beliefs have been passed down relatively unchanged through generations of
settlers for nearly four centuries. These beliefs center around the worship of
some sort of demon or god from the outer reaches of space, which visited the
earth millions of years ago and will return some day to wreak terrible
destruction. I am unclear on the exact details as there is very little
historical information available on this tribe, unless the University is hiding
material from me, which I am half-convinced it may well be.

"The ringleaders of this cult are and have always been the Verlac family. Every
second generation a male Verlac is born, and the role of high priest is passed
down from grandfather to grandson, following some arcane ritual of ascension.
There is a persistent legend that this ritual somehow involves a transmigration
of souls -- that, in fact, all male Verlacs are actually the reincarnation of
the original founder of the American line. Although this is obviously nothing
more than local superstition, the legend has such a hold on the people of the
region that it may have become a self-perpetuating delusion on the part of the
members of the Verlac family, each male child honestly believing that he is his
own grandfather reborn. Edward Verlac rejected this obscene birthright, and I
believe that the townspeople drove him to insanity for it.

"Regardless of the truth behind these legends, the cult is planning to act very
soon. In the 1920s, Edward's grandfather Mordecai Verlac began preaching that
the return of the 'Nameless God' was imminent -- specifically, that it would
occur the day after tomorrow. He re-opened the defunct paper mill, converting it
into a factory to build some sort of device, a 'beacon' with which to facilitate
the Nameless God's entry into this world. This device is very nearly finished,
and in two days they will be ready to enact their great ritual -- what they call
the 'Blessed Event'. It will most likely entail the wholesale slaughter of every
non-cultist man, woman and child in the city. The child abductions of the past
few years were most likely preparatory sacrifices perpetrated by the cult, and
there is no reason to believe that the killing will stop once their great ritual
is complete.

"If you are, in fact, the young man who planned to move into the Verlac estate,
you must be careful. The cult is almost certainly watching your every move, and
will attempt to induct and brainwash you into their cult or, failing that,
murder both you and your wife. I had hoped to warn you upon your arrival;
however, as the message on my answering machine this morning attests, I don't
have much time left. With any luck, I'll be out of the city by tonight. If I
don't make it, please try to stop these people. This key might help -- I managed
to dig it out our old property file on the lighthouse. I know they consider that
building important for some reason. Do what you can with it. And be careful.
These cultists are a menace, inbred and insane to the last man, and no one will
be safe until they are wiped off the face of the earth.

"Good luck, and be careful.

-- Claudia Benson"

As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

There appears to be a commotion of sorts to the south, where a group of
townsfolk have gathered.

>w

Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a
country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the
east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make
out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

>n

Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the
south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning
gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in
the other.

>w
As you cross the railroad tracks, the air becomes warmer, more dingy, and
slightly more difficult to breathe.

Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to
the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this
charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south.
To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

>n

Shanty Town
The road peters out at a wide clearing of rutted mud, flanked by uneven rows of
decrepit, clapboard shacks. The town is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits
of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the wind betray the overall stillness.

The cold wind cuts through your clothes, chilling you to the bone.

>x shacks
All peeling paint, broken glass and missing shingles, the houses are poorly
built and teetering on the verge of falling apart completely. They are arranged
in a vague suggestion of rows on either side of the mud clearing, numbered #1
through #12 with those cheap little nail-up plastic numbers you can buy at
hardware stores. Presumably, these denote each shack's "street address".

Curtains twitch behind a grimy windowpane, and you glance over in time to see a
lean, suspicious face pulling back into the shadows.

>knock on door 11
After a moment or two of silence, you hear a furtive rattling, and the door
opens a crack to reveal a woman's pale and haggard face. She stares out you with
a mixture of trepidation and mistrust.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting
on the wind. You look to the east in time to see the train go by, rolling
southwest past the mill toward less melancholy climes.

A pair of starving dogs come sniffing around the refuse by one of the shacks,
but as soon as you move they shy away, disappearing over the edge of the
clearing.

>x woman
She is pale and thin from lack of food. Her hair is prematurely gray. The dismal
poverty and constant fear that she has lived in all her life have leached her
body of its youth, leaving her aged before her time, stooped and scarred with
worry. She clutches a tattered shawl, its fabric the faded color of old
dishwater, close around her throat, and she watches you the way a wounded rabbit
might watch a potentially hungry cat.

Flakes of ash drift gently down from the sky like gray snow, coating everything
with a thin layer of soot.

>ask woman about jeffrey
The woman grows even paler, and draws back from the door with a look of
horrified loss.

Suddenly the woman slams the door shut, and you hear the rattle of a bolt being
drawn.

>knock on door 11
After a moment or two of silence, you hear a furtive rattling, and the door

(slipping the old tin into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
The woman's eyes widen in sudden recognition, and she takes the teddy bear from
you, turning it over to read the name stitched on the back. Tears well up in her
eyes, spilling over onto her pale, sunken cheeks. "This is my boy's," she
whispers. "This is Jeffrey's."

She looks at you suddenly. "Where did you find this? Did you find..." but then
she stops. She can see from your face that you have not found her son, only this
one clue. But... even one clue, however tenuous, offers possibility. And the
woman's face softens, just a little bit, with something that you guess hasn't
made its home there in a very, very, long time:

Hope.

"Come in," she says softly. "Thank you for bringing me this. Please, come in."

She steps aside from the door, and you enter her home.

#11 Mill Town Road
A dirty, ramshackle home, scraped together out of the bits and ends of working-
class poverty. The floor is warped and broken wood, bare dirt showing through
the cracks between boards. Rags hang across the window in lieu of curtains. Over
in the far corner is a rickety old stove; in the opposite corner a threadbare
cot; it hits you suddenly that a family of three once lived, slept and ate all
in this single room, which is slightly smaller than your bedroom back at the
house.

The woman watches you expectantly.

poke up like the legs of dead insects. The ruins are surrounded on all sides by

Just as the mechanical noises reach a crescendo, the pipes at the north end of

You are wearing your trenchcoat, your clothes, a silver locket and your wedding

written letter and a hooded robe.

The pockets of your trenchcoat contain a flashlight, a keyring, on which are
eight keys (a long steel key, a tarnished bronze key, a small steel key, an old-
fashioned brass key, a small copper key, an old-fashioned iron key, a key to the
house and a key to the cellar), an old tin (which is closed), a meat hook, a
tattered drawing, a strange metal flute, a puzzle box (which is open but empty),
a towel, a gold locket, a newspaper, a letter opener, an animal's skull, a slip
of paper, Michael's faculty card, a family album, a bundle of soggy pages, a
torn journal and your umbrella.

Just as the mechanical noises reach a crescendo, the pipes at the north end of
the crawlway suddenly give vent to an enormous gout of superheated steam. The
entire north half of the crawlway is momentarily filled with vapor and intense
heat, which just as quickly dissipates. The noise behind the walls recedes to a
calmer level, and the needle on the gauge swings back down to zero.

>look

Maintenance Access Tunnel
You are at the southern end of a long, narrow crawlway leading northward into
the mill. All around you, through the metallic walls, you can hear the
oppressive thumping and grinding of heavy machinery. The air in here is hot and
smells of burnt engine oil.

A large metal valve wheel juts out from the middle of one of the many fat,
sweating pipes lining the walls. Just to its left is a gauge of some sort.

You can also see a book of matches here.

You drape the towel over the valve wheel.

vibration ripples up and down the crawlway.

>turn wheel
You grip the sides of the wheel -- even through the towel, you can feel the heat
radiating from it -- and haul it clockwise with all your strength. It squeaks
reluctantly at first, then gives all at once. From down the corridor you hear an
enormous hissing rush as steam is vented from the pipes, and the needle in the

are almost blistering to the touch.

The hatch is closed.

You shove the handle down, and it remains in the lowered position when you let

Mill Floor
Waves of heat and noise assault you from every corner. Towering above you on all
sides are the enormous vats, presses and sundry machinery, the ever-churning
inner workings of the paper mill. An opening in the base of the south wall leads
back to the maintenance crawlway, and narrow aisles lead in several other
directions through the chugging machinery. A grilled catwalk high over your head
provides a more direct route across the factory; however, you see no way to get
up there from here.

A long chain dangles from overhead, its last few feet pooled on the floor next
to a bank of controls.

>x vats
The machines squat like gigantic mechanical trolls all around you, ceaselessly
clanking, groaning, vibrating and spitting steam.

Strange; although you could hardly call yourself acquainted with the workings of
a paper mill, you can't help but notice that none of the machines you can see
seem to be involved with anything like the making of paper. At any rate, you
don't see any paper -- or any wood pulp, or any dye, or anything else you might
reasonably assume a paper mill would have on hand -- anywhere. The machines are
definitely busy churning out something -- but what?

>x catwalk
You needn't worry about that.

>look up
You can just make out the system of pulleys through which the chain is threaded,
way up at the ceiling.

>x chain
It runs all the way up past the catwalk to the ceiling. Its links look somewhat
greasy.

>climb up on chain
You can't see any such thing.

>up
You can't go that way.

>climb
(the newspaper)
You won't get very far climbing that.

>climb chain
The chain is too greasy for you to get a good grip on it.

>tie chain on me
You wrap the chain around your waist a few times.

>x controls
The waist-high bank has all number of arcane lights, dials and gauges on it;
however, the only two controls that bear mentioning are a lever and a large red
button.

>x lever
The lever juts out about a foot from the panel.

>x button
It's a large button, colored bright red.

>push button
The control panel emits a nasty buzzing sound.

>push button
The control panel emits a nasty buzzing sound.

>pull lever
You feel something click as the lever activates a hidden releasing mechanism;
then, suddenly, the chain pulls taut and jerks you off your feet, hauling you up
through the air -- narrowly missing a piece of heavy equipment sailing past you
on its way down -- all the way up to the catwalk, where the chain slows and
finally stops, depositing you safely, though left somewhat breathless, on the
grilled surface.

Catwalk
The catwalk stretches north, a narrow ribbon of metal grillwork dangling fifty
feet over the factory floor and shuddering dangerously in time with the machines
beneath it. There are no railings of any kind. At the far end you can see what
looks like a wide balcony with several large banks of equipment.

A long chain dangles from overhead, its last few feet wrapped securely around
your waist.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

>untie chain
You disentangle yourself from the chain.

Workshop
Several workbenches and racks of arcane electronic equipment have been dragged
together to form a sort of open laboratory on this wide balcony overlooking the
mill. A wide table dominates the area, strewn with precision tools, bits of
wire, and scribbled calculations. To the south, a narrow catwalk hangs above the
mill floor, and a metal ladder leads down into the machinery below.

Prominent among the strange tools scattered across the table is a strange
caliper-like instrument.

On the workbenches are some notes and some arcane electronic equipment.

One of the racks contains a number of circular mirrors, stacked side by side
like dishes in a dishwasher.

Tacked up on the wall is a large technical blueprint.

>x workbenches
The benches are strewn with scribbled notes and bits of arcane electronic
equipment.

>x notes
The notes are a mess of incomprehensibly scrawled numbers; long printouts of
technical data, tangled diagrams and complex formulae. Even if you had the
slightest idea what all the calculations meant, the numbers are barely even
legible.

Lifting up a sheet of cribbed equations, you notice what looks to be a general
memo to all mill workers.

>read memo
It's a flimsy sheet of paper with the following message printed on it:

!!NOTICE TO ALL BRETHREN!!
The focusing mirrors must be kept absolutely clean at ALL TIMES. Even the
slightest smudge of dirt or grease can create dangerous instabilities in the
refraction patterns.

All mirrors must receive ionization treatment as a matter of course. As an extra
precaution, however, always use sterilized surgical gloves when handling them.

In the Name of He Who Is Named Not,
the Mgt.

>x blueprint
The blueprint is a technical schematic for some extremely complicated device,
the exact purpose of which is anything but clear. It looks a bit like a
telescope, a bit like a microwave oven turned inside out, and a bit like the
"industrial laser" from Goldfinger. The inner workings of the device involve a
complicated arrangement of lenses and mirrors and a hopeless tangle of circuitry
that vaguely resembles several dozen street maps of Manhattan laid across each
other. Some of the notations on the circuitry don't even look like technical
symbols; they look more like cabbalistic runes.

Next to what must represent the main focusing mirror of the device, someone has
written the number "0.0113"; someone else, in another handwriting, has scratched
that number out and written below it, "0.0157".

Which do you mean, the calipers or the strange metal flute?

>calipers
Made of stainless steel, molded in a strangely flowing, almost organic design,
the calipers -- if that is what they are -- resemble no other tool you've ever
seen. It has three independently adjustable arms, each ending in a needle-point
pincer, which fold back on themselves at grotesque, asymetrical angles toward a
floating center point. There is a calibrated readout set near the base, which
presumably provides a measure of whatever strange contortion of space is
occupied by whatever object is placed between the pincers at the tool's other
end.

You pick up the mirror labeled #1. The mirror is perfectly round and exquisitely
polished. It is very slightly concave on its reflecting surface, distorting the
edges of your face as you stare into it. On the back is a small label with the
number 1 written on it.

>put mirror 1 in caliper
The instrument holds the mirror delicately clamped between its pincers; the

Mill Floor, on the block of heavy equipment
Waves of heat and noise assault you from every corner. Towering above you on all
sides are the enormous vats, presses and sundry machinery, the ever-churning
inner workings of the paper mill. An opening in the base of the south wall leads
back to the maintenance crawlway, and narrow aisles lead in several other
directions through the chugging machinery. A grilled catwalk high over your head
provides a more direct route across the factory; however, you see no way to get

Maintenance Access Tunnel
You are at the southern end of a long, narrow crawlway leading northward into
the mill. All around you, through the metallic walls, you can hear the
oppressive thumping and grinding of heavy machinery. The air in here is hot and
smells of burnt engine oil.

A large metal valve wheel juts out from the middle of one of the many fat,
sweating pipes lining the walls. Just to its left is a gauge of some sort.

>s

Bare Foundations
The foundations of an older structure lie crumbling in a sunken square of
ground, hidden away behind the imposing shadow of the mill wall. Weeds push up
through cracked and buckling slabs of concrete; twisted rebar and rusting pipes
poke up like the legs of dead insects. The ruins are surrounded on all sides by
dense thickets, although narrow, overgrown trails lead northeast and southeast
through the underbrush.

Set into the base of the mill wall, nearly covered by the thickets, is a metal
hatch.

>ne
The path curves to the north, leading you around to the front of the mill.

Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to
the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this
charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south.
To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

surmounted by blackened stumps of smokestacks that continuously belch fat,
rolling clouds of smoke into the leaden sky.

>e
As you cross the railroad tracks, the air seems to lift slightly, becoming more
breathable once again.

Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the
south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning
gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in
the other.

A distant flicker of movement draws your eyes to the faraway lighthouse. A lone
figure, tiny in the distance, makes its way stealthily around the small spur of
rock at the end of the breakwater and slips inside the door at the tower's base.
It's impossible to see the person's face from this distance, but the hair, the
way he walks... you'd swear it was Michael.

>e
The road heads out over a narrow breakwater jutting out into the ocean.

Breakwater
You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the
road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to
the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of
Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.

>ne

At the Foot of the Lighthouse
You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every
side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous
pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the
southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down
the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.

The great bronze door of the lighthouse stands slightly ajar, revealing a narrow
rectangle of blackness within.

>e

Bottom of the Lighthouse
The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the
air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of
hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a
narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.

>inv

>put robe in coat
No matter how tightly you roll up the heavy robe, it is still too big to fit in
your pocket.

>up
You climb the winding stairs in a gradual spiral around the inner circumference
of the tower, and finally emerge, breathless, at the top.

Top of the Lighthouse
The stairs give onto a wide, circular chamber surrounded by windows. The glass
is old and streaked with grime, but you still have to catch your breath at the
magnificence of the view. In one direction, the dying heath and the stunted
cluster of buildings that is Anchorhead; in the other, the ocean like a vast,
undulating blanket.

Sitting in the middle of the room is what looks like a swivel mount of some
kind, although nothing is mounted on it now. Looking up, you see that it rests
directly below a large, hexagonal skylight.

>x mount
The mounting is ring-shaped, about three feet in diameter, and is designed to
allow whatever is to be mounted on it to turn freely in all directions. It was
probably originally intended to hold the beacon when the lighthouse was still in
operation.

>x skylight
That big, churning hole in the sky is perfectly framed by the hexagonal
skylight.

>x glass

It's an old-fashioned hurricane lamp, with a tall glass chimney to protect it
from the wind. The cotton wick burns fitfully in its reservoir of cheap oil.

>x windows
The view -- which encompasses the ocean, the heath, the town of Anchorhead and
even the distant paper mill -- is magnificent.

Bottom of the Lighthouse
The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the
air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of
hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a
narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.

There is a faint scuffing noise from the shadows behind you -- before you can
turn around, something slams into the back of your head with brutal force.
Sparks go off in front of your eyes, and you fall to the cool concrete floor
with the world reeling under you. As you kneel there, dazed and struggling not
to pass out, your assailant walks slowly around you. He pauses, as if wondering
whether or not to finish you off.

Terror and nausea wash over you in alternating waves. You are too weak to look
up and see his face, but you recognize his shoes easily enough. After all, you
helped him pick them out not three weeks ago.

More footsteps come down the stairs, and you sense a number of men standing
around you. "We'll take care of her, Your Holiness," rasps an old, weathered
voice. Rough hands start to drag you to your feet.

"No," says Michael, and the hands pause.

"Your Holiness, she has seen too much," protests the raspy voice. "She must be
killed."

"That won't be necessary," Michael says. "Put her somewhere out of the way,
where she can't get into any more trouble. I'll deal with her myself... after
the Blessed Event."

The horror and pain are too much; the darkness overwhelms you. You try to catch
a glimpse of your husband's face as the men drag you away, but in your clouding
vision all you can see are a pair of burning, red-rimmed eyes...




[           * THE LAST NIGHT *

The most merciful thing in the world, I
think, is the inability of the human
mind to correlate all its contents. We
live on a placid island of ignorance in
the midst of black seas of infinity,
and it was not meant that we should
voyage far... but some day the piecing
together of dissociated knowledge will
open up such terrifying vistas of
reality, and of our frightful position
therein, that we shall either go mad
from the revelation or flee from the
deadly light into the peace and safety
of a new dark age.

-- H.P. Lovecraft]




Numb.

You float slowly to consciousness like a bubble rising to the surface of some
warm, thick oil. You are numb.

For several minutes, that is as much as your battered mind can handle, that one
thought: you are numb.

Then your head becomes a bit clearer, and you connect the thought with the
sensations trying to make their way through your foggy brain. You are numb. Your
arms. You can't feel your arms at all.

You try to get up but you can't move; you merely flop over onto your stomach
like a struggling worm. You roll back over and sit up, and at last your vision
clears and you finally get a good look around, and the horror of your situation
finally slams home...

Padded Cell
You are in a padded cell, the kind typically reserved for raving lunatics. The
room is barely eight feet by eight feet square, with walls and floor of concrete
covered with thick, quilted padding. The door in the west wall is also covered
with padding, except for a tiny observation window about five feet up, from
which a feeble light trickles in.

>x walls

>look through windows

>look through window
You can see an empty hallway outside. Across the hall is another door.

>x window
The tiny window is made of thick, reinforced glass.

>break door
You take a few steps back, draw a deep breath, and hurl your body at the door.
It shudders violently, and you thought you felt something give.

An itch strikes you suddenly on the inside of your left elbow. For the next
minute or two you can only clench your teeth in agony, powerless to scratch it,
until the wretched sensation goes away on its own.

>break door
With a defiant shout, you launch your body at the door. Something snaps (the
door? you think incoherently, or your shoulder?), and the door flies open,
sending you sprawling out into the hallway.

Hallway
A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. This is the north end;
the hallway runs south from here. Doors lead east and west, and a narrow, barred
window to the north looks out onto the dark corner outside.

A shard of glass from the broken window lies on the floor.

>get glass

Painstakingly, you get down on your knees and very, very carefully pick up the
shard of glass with your teeth.

Building maintenance is obviously not a big priority at this institution. The
wall around the window casement is cracked in several places -- some of the
cracks are quite large. The window pane itself is broken in, probably by a
misguided bird sometime in the recent past.

>x cracks
A jagged network of cracks has spread out around the bottom edge of the window
as the wall slowly settles. One crack is nearly a quarter-inch wide.

>put glass in crack
(the shard of glass in the crack)
You wedge the shard of glass into the crack, its sharp edge pointing outward.

>cut jacket with glass
(the shard of glass)
Carefully, you lean back against the wall and start shrugging your shoulders
against the jutting glass shard. After what seems like an eternity, you feel the
straps begin to fray and loosen, until suddenly the strait jacket grows slack
and slips free. You shake the horrible garment off in disgust, giving it a
vicious kick for good measure as you gingerly rub feeling back into your arms.

Hallway
A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. This is the north end;
the hallway runs south from here. Doors lead east and west, and a narrow, barred
window to the north looks out onto the dark corner outside.

There is a jagged shard of glass poking out of the wall here, underneath the
window.

You can also see a strait jacket here.

>x jacket
It's a canvas strait jacket, the kind used to immobilize violent or spastic
mental patients. It fastens up the back with a complex series of buckles and
straps, while the sleeves cross the chest and fasten around back, making it
quite impossible to escape. The thing is useless now, of course, since all the
straps have been cut through.

Something about the observation window in the western cell door catches your
eye; it looks like it has blood on it.

>x window
Which do you mean, the west observation window or the east observation window?

>west
The thick, reinforced glass of the tiny observation window is shattered, with
only the criss-crossing reinforcement wire holding it together. It bulges
outward slightly, as well. An ugly brown smear of dried blood obscures the inner
surface of the glass. With mounting disgust, you notice several strands of dark
hair still stuck to the congealed stain.

The door is latched with a simple sliding bolt.

Padded Cell
Another padded cell, much like the rest. There is a door in the east wall.

The padding in this room seems a bit worse for the wear; murky bloodstains
spatter the canvas near the door, and there is a large tear down in the corner
of the cell, with bits of stuffing leaking out.

>x tear
The canvas is frayed and jaggedly torn. It looks as though someone might have
gnawed through it with their teeth.

>look in tear
In the ragged tear is a torn square of canvas.

>get square

As you carefully pull the ragged piece of canvas from its hiding place,
something pricks you sharply on the finger. You jerk your hand away; then,
peering into the tear once again, you notice an old, crusted needle embedded in
the stuffing.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

It's roughly six inches to a side and covered front and back with uneven, barely

"My name is Edward Verlac, and this is my testament:

"I am utterly, utterly mad.

"They have locked me in here for my own safety -- and for the safety of others.
My arms are bound in a strait jacket. Yet this is no less than I deserve. I am
writing this using a needle dropped carelessly by one of the orderlies some
weeks ago; biting my lip to draw blood for the ink, I hold the tiny steel quill
beneath my teeth to write. This exhaustive task shall be my last on earth; when
I am finished, I shall dash my brains out against the cell window. The last of
the Verlacs will be dead, and the world made a slightly brighter place thereby.

"Know this: I did not slip into madness through any weakness or congenital
defect (except insofar as my blood is indelibly tainted with the cursed ichor of
the Verlac line) -- I was driven mad by the spectre of my great-great ancestor,
Croseus Verlac. For generations that fiend has traveled down the family line,
passing from body to body in a hideous, incestuous ritual whereby he impregnates
his own daughter, then projects his black soul into the innocent body of his
infant grandson. I myself was horrified to discover that I am in fact the
progeny of my own grandfather, Mordecai Verlac, and his wretched, tormented
daughter -- my mother, Anna. The experiment failed on the first attempt,
producing William, my sickly, malformed elder brother whom I never knew.
William, however, died while still a toddler -- or so my mother has always told
me -- and the next unholy coupling resulted in me.

"From as early as I can remember, I could feel the lurking presence of my
grandfather, who died the day I was born, and who I now realize was little more
than a fleshly disguise for the pernicious warlock Croseus. He stalked the
boundaries of my mind, seeking a means of entrance, of condemning my soul to
limbo and taking up a fresh, new abode in my young limbs. His evil, red-rimmed
eyes haunted my every dream and o'ershadowed even my waking hours. The amulet my
mother gave me while I was still in the crib protected me -- for the old man
cannot abide its presence, and must flee all who wear it -- but Mother died
while I was still young, and since then my folly has brought tragedy to myself
and to all those I love.

"The memory of my mother's urgent warnings faded soon after her death. I became
embarrassed by the scandal that seemed to hover over my family name like a pall,
and was mortified by the superstitious trinket that I still wore around my neck,
as if in ignorant servitude to those old myths. The red-rimmed eyes had not
given me nightmares since my twelfth birthday, and I dismissed them as an
immature fancy that had passed along with my boyhood. At the age of 21, I pawned
the amulet at a magic shop somewhere in town, and thereby sealed my doom.

"For ten years I have resisted Croseus' demonic encroachment upon my mind, my
soul, my very being, with only the strength of my will. It was not enough. I
found my mind flooded at the oddest times with strange, antiquarian memories; my
speech and mannerisms lapsed into uncharacteristic, archaic patterns; and worst
of all, I found myself looking at my dear daughter Gertrude -- only seven years
old! -- in the most unwholesome way, with the most unmentionable ideas creeping
through my subconscious.

"I scoured every street in this cursed town, looking for that magic shop, but I
have never found it. In desperation I began delving into old histories and
forbidden genealogies, researching the history of the dread Verlac name for some
solution to my plight. I discovered no answers, only the horrors I have just
written of. But I also discovered something worse -- the ultimate purpose behind
the old demon's nefarious bodysnatching!

"He plans to unleash a primordial evil such that the earth could not possibly
survive. I have seen the plans and the blueprints; I have read the dread tome in
my great-great grandfather's church; I have used the obsidian lens that is not
true obsidian, and I have looked upon what that madman means to draw down onto
this earth! He and this town, his foul congregation of fanatics and madmen! They
are all a part of it! They have been watching me, waiting for me to change,
waiting for the return of their monstrous high priest!!

"It was then that I realized that killing only myself would not be enough; for
the degenerate inhabitants of this town would hunt down my family and wreak a
terrible vengeance if I took from them their Messiah. And besides; who could say
whether the crafty devil Croseus might not concoct some new way to enter the
world, through a new body -- through that of one of my daughters, perhaps? The
ritual has always demanded a grandson, but Croseus was never one to let such a
trivial inconvenience stop him. He would find a way. He always returns to his
blood.

"I did the only thing I could do -- Julia, I am so terribly sorry, but I will be
with you soon -- I could not let him have you, or Gertrude or Sonia -- and I
will not let him have me. Say good-bye to the last of the Verlacs -- there will
be no blood for him once I am gone."

Something about the observation window in the western cell door catches your
eye; it looks like it has blood on it.

You are stopped halfway to the stairs by a loud banging noise behind you.

You turn around -- there it is again. A loud, shuddering bang, like something
heavy slamming into something wooden -- and you see a cell door halfway down the
hall shiver in its frame.

Looks like someone else is trying out your brilliant escape plan.

The door is hit a third time, the latch snaps and the door flies open, and a
filthy, ragged man staggers out into the hall. You have just enough time to
notice -- with no small amount of disquiet -- that the man is not wearing a
strait jacket, and then he looks up at you and grins an utterly psychotic grin.

A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. The hallway runs south

The orderly's porno magazine lies discarded on the floor, just outside the

Waiting Room
Ugly, mint-green tiles and walls of whitewashed cinderblock comprise the decor
of this inhospitable waiting room. A hard little sofa upholstered in avocado
vinyl and a feebly struggling potted palm are provided for the comfort of
visitors, although you get the feeling that few inmates of this institution are
fortunate enough to have visitors. A metal gate bars entrance to a southern
passageway, which you assume leads to the inmates' section. The exit lies north.

The orderly is lying face down in a pool of blood in the middle of the room.

The orderly's name tag lies on the floor nearby.

Asylum Courtyard
The grim, white-washed edifice of Danvers Asylum bounds this tiny, shadowed
courtyard to the south, its narrow, barred windows staring blankly down at you
like ranks of shriveled, empty eye sockets. You can escape through a narrow
gateway in the high, brick wall to the north.

The madman comes prancing out the front door of the asylum, and suddenly stops
dead in his tracks. He looks around, utterly dumbfounded. He looks up at the
sky, and feels the raindrops striking his face. Slowly it dawns on his addled
brain that he is outside; that he is, in fact, free.

With a wild whoop of pure joy, the madman hobbles away down the street, laughing
and chattering to himself with such unabashed happiness that for a moment you
almost forget that you have just let loose a dangerous and quite probably
homicidal psychotic into the world at large.

Then again, you think, in this town he might just fit right in.

Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides
by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this
city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to
the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley
Bridge.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking
grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of
some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

As you step into the open square you hear a sudden commotion -- several crowds
of people are converging onto the town square from different directions. You can
hear their shouts and see the flickering glow of their torches as the mob begins
to swarm in from the north and east.

>wait
Time passes.

The obelisk glows red with the bloody light of their torches. They are almost
here; you'd better find somewhere to hide, quickly.

>wait
Time passes.

Robed men brandishing torches pour into the square, rallying around the obelisk
at its center. Several of them seem to be struggling with someone. You huddle
back into the shadows, but  no one seems to notice yet another robed figure in
the midst of the crowd. For the moment, it seems, you are safe.

>wait
You wait, helplessly.

The struggling men step forward, and you can see they have the old bum from the
vacant lot. His wrists are bound and his arms held by two cultists on either
side. Although he screams and writhes with frantic desperation, the frail old
drunkard is no match for his captors. Someone raises his hands for silence --
you can't quite see him from where you are -- and the mob quiets down. Even the
old bum's screams lower to a fearful whimpering.

Overhead, the swollen clouds flicker ominously with a greenish haze of sheet
lightning.

>wait
You wait, helplessly.

"My brethren," intones the leader, "we are gathered here to mete out bloody
justice upon one who has sinned against us. This one," -- he jabs a finger at
the old bum -- "has divulged our secrets to an outsider and betrayed the sacred
trust of our brotherhood! For this, his soul must be condemned forever, embraced
and encysted within the necrotic folds of the Womb of Nehilim!"

At this, the crowd lets loose with a roar of approval, while the old bum throws
back his head and shrieks helplessly into the storm.

>wait
You wait, helplessly.

The cultists drag the bum over to the monument and prepare to lift him up.
Suddenly, he makes a break for it, bolting through the pressing crowd and
running, by some grotesque twist of luck, straight at you.

The old man stops short. The flickering torchlight illuminates your face, and
his eyes widen in recognition. He opens his mouth to speak...

And four burly cultists tackle him simultaneously, pulling him down. As the old
man's body hits the ground, a small, shiny object falls out of the bum's clothes
and bounces out across the cobblestones, unnoticed by all.

The cultists carry the bum back and lift him up onto the monument, hanging him
by the wrists from the iron ring set into its tip.

>put all in pocket

"Please," sobs the old man pitifully, "please, I didn't, I swear, I didn't tell
nobody nothing, so I didn't! I SWEAR TO GOD I DIDN'T TELL -- "

Before the poor old man can finish his plea, a dozen cultists brandishing long
metal rods begin brutally beating him. You avert your eyes; his screams are
quickly cut off as his ribs are staved in, and soon all you can hear are the
horrible thuds, and the wet snapping sound of breaking bones.

Although it seems to go on forever, the slaughter is finished in less than a
minute. The crowd backs away, its cheering and chanting diminished to a low,
hypnotic murmur. The cultists quickly disperse back into the streets, and within
moments the square is once again empty... except for the mutilated thing hanging
from the obelisk.

Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is
possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

As you approach the bridge, you see a hulking shadow lurking about on the far
bank. You slow down warily, remembering the townsfolk who threatened you
earlier, peering through the darkness and obscuring rain to catch a glimpse of
the person. Then the figure moves slightly, and you realize that it's much
larger than a man; in fact, the figure isn't shaped anything like a man at all.

A sudden crack of lightning illuminates the bridge for a brief, horrible instant
-- and in that instant, you see it.

In the next few moments, your battered mind manages to blot out the memory of
that bloated, barrel-like, armless trunk; those thick, double-jointed legs that
end in shiny black hooves; that writhing forest of fleshy tendrils crowning the
torso in place of a proper head -- but you are not, and will never be, able to
banish the horrible, searing memory of the thing's misplaced face which leers
madly out at you from the side of the trunk -- that child's face on a monster's
body!

A sizzling bolt of lightning cuts through the night sky, illuminating your
surroundings in a sudden sheet of blinding white radiance that leaves eerie,
green afterimages scarred onto your retinas.

The creature lurches toward you, its hooved feet thumping heavily on the old
stone bridge.

>give gold locket to creature
(first taking the gold locket)
You toss the gold locket at the monster's feet, and the clasp springs open when
it hits the cobblestones, revealing the woman's portrait inside. The creature
looks down and is immediately captivated. It bends over awkwardly, delicately
grasps the chain with the tip of one tentacle, and holds the locket up to its
face.

For a single heartbeat of time, even the storm seems to hold still. The little
boy's face gazes at the picture in the locket for a long, aching moment. And a
silent tear wells up in the corner of its eye and trickles down its cheek.

*** ka-WHAM!!! ***

A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its
foundations.

The monster ignores you for the moment, fascinated by the portrait of its
mother.

>hit creature with hook
(first taking the meat hook)
With a hoarse yell of desperation, you raise the meat hook over your head and
fly at the monster while its attention is absorbed by the tiny picture of its
mother.

It never even sees you coming. With brutal accuracy, you sink the meat hook deep
into the left eye of the little boy's face. It screams, a high, squawling wail
like a frightened infant, and a thick, black ichor spurts from the wound. It
thrashes about helplessly, knocking you onto the ground, and you scramble back
on your hands and feet crab-style, trying to get away from its struggles.

Another flash of lightning, and you see the thing stagger over to the side of
the bridge. One tentacle manages to pluck out the hook, which clatters to the
pavement -- but the damage has been done. The monster hits the stone parapet,
overbalances, and goes over the side, taking the locket with it. It hits the
water with a giant splash and is instantly engulfed by the raging current. By
the time you get to your feet, rush to the side and look over, the monster's
body is gone.

As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the

a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a

The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the

gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in
the other.

A group of cultists passes you, heading north from the town.

The cultists, thinking you are one of their own, pass by silently.

The road heads out over a narrow breakwater jutting out into the ocean.

Breakwater
You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the
road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to
the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of
Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting
on the wind.

At the Foot of the Lighthouse
You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every
side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous
pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the
southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down
the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

With great effort, you manage to pull the ancient, creaking door open a few
inches, enough to slip through.

Bottom of the Lighthouse
The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the
air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of
hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a
narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.

>up
You climb the winding stairs in a gradual spiral around the inner circumference
of the tower, and finally emerge, breathless, at the top.

Top of the Lighthouse
The stairs give onto a wide, circular chamber surrounded by windows. The glass
is old and streaked with grime, but you still have to catch your breath at the
magnificence of the view. In one direction, the dying heath and the stunted
cluster of buildings that is Anchorhead; in the other, the ocean like a vast,
undulating blanket.

Sitting in the middle of the room, beneath a large, hexagonal skylight, is the
most bizarre, incomprehensibly complicated device you have ever seen.

*** ka-WHAM!!! ***

A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its
foundations.

>x device
It looks a bit like a telescope, a bit like a microwave oven turned inside out,
and a bit like the "industrial laser" from Goldfinger. It's pointed almost
straight up, right through the skylight, aimed directly at the rumbling hole in
the sky. Its exact purpose is unfathomable, but it is emitting an ominous,
throbbing hum and radiating a curious warmth that causes an unwholesome
prickling sensation all over your skin.

Most of the exposed components are too complex to comprehend, but there is a
receptacle about two thirds of the way along the thing's -- er, "barrel" -- that
contains a round mirror, like a focusing mirror in a telescope. It looks as
though you could remove it.

Michael smirks as he advances on you. "You're quite a persistent little tart,
aren't you? Quite the gutsy little irritant. I suppose Michael must have been
one of those 'modern' men; didn't go in for the submissive type." Michael -- or
whatever fiend is speaking from behind Michael's face -- sneers. "Didn't have
the balls for it, is my guess. In my day, we knew how to keep our wives. A
headstrong woman should be broken in, just like a headstrong horse."

>x michael
He is someone else, now, someone you have never known and would never want to
know. His flesh is gaunt; his skin waxy and pale; his forehead burning and
feverish. And his eyes... you can't bear to look into the seething madness of
those wild, red-rimmed eyes. Your husband is gone, now -- some other, alien
force has devoured him from within and now animates his body.

Michael walks past you and runs his fingers along the strange device.

"My, my, you do keep busy," Michael remarks when he finds the focusing mirror
missing. "It's a good thing I caught you in time." He turns to you and holds out
his hand. "Your little game is over now, woman, and you've lost. Give me the
mirror now."

>x guards
The guards eye you with malice and a certain hunger, as if they were just
waiting for an excuse to tear you to pieces.

Michael glares at you with impatience. "Give me the mirror, woman," he hisses
into your face. "Don't make me damage you..."

>save
Ok.

>x michael's eyes
You can't see any such thing.

>x eyes
You can't see any such thing.

>give mirror 2 to michael
(first taking the mirror labeled #2)
"That's more like it," Michael says.

Michael pauses, glances down at the mirror in his hand, then smirks at you. "But
of course, there's no telling where else you've been poking around, what you
might have gotten your dirty little hands on, hmm?"

He leans in close to you, and you can smell corruption on his breath like
rotting oranges. "I've been wondering where this had gotten off to," he murmurs
in your ear, taking the caliper-like instrument from you. He applies the
instrument to the mirror, and frowns as he checks the readout.

Then he smiles.

"Well, that's that then," he says, placing the mirror back in its receptacle. He
nods toward the guards, who seize you and begin dragging you down the stairs.

"It's time to clue you in to just what's been going on around here," Michael
says, following behind you. "First hand. I think you'll find it quite...
enthralling."

You are dragged bodily down to the foot of the lighthouse and around to the
rocky outcropping, where an island of flesh floats just beyond the breakwater's
tip. The guards shove their way through the crowds of robed supplicants,
carrying you to the island's center. They force you to your knees and, despite
your best efforts at escape, manhandle you into a pair of handcuffs looped
through an iron ring set in a heavy stone block. The block is so low, you are
forced to remain kneeling in the squelchy muck, craning your neck to watch the
orgiastic ceremoney taking place... and your husband -- no, you tell yourself,
not your husband; the creature that your husband has become -- leading the
terrible rites.

Island of Flesh
The island is barely forty feet across, its surface covered with an ankle-deep
layer of slime and muck. Underneath the muck, the ground throbs -- heaving
rhythmically to a blasphemous, living pulse.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

The robed guards hover to either side of you, waiting for you to make a move.

Michael stands in the center of it all, leading the hellish rites.

Robed cultists crowd around on every side -- some of them brandishing flaming
torches, some of them chanting in some hideous, archaic tongue, all of them
swaying to the hypnotic pulse that rises up from the depths of the fleshy
ground.

You are handcuffed to one of several heavy stone blocks set in a rough
semicircle around the center of the island.

Lashed to a stake in the center of the island is a young boy.

>x island
The fleshy surface of this island is covered in reeking slime. It shivers
beneath you to some horrible pulse.

>x sea
The sea is the color of old pewter, surging and chopping restlessly beneath the
clouds.

Michael takes up a torch from one of the crowd. Holding it high above his head,
he turns to the lighthouse and intones:

"Iach! That Which May Not Be Named, I call upon Thee! Formless Drifter of the
Gulfs Between, I summon Thee!"

The crowd murmurs in ecstatic encouragement.

>x guards
The guards eye you with malice and a certain hunger, as if they were just
waiting for an excuse to tear you to pieces.

"I cast aside the Seals! I throw open the Gates!"

Michael traces a mystic sigil in the air in front of him with the flaming torch.
The flames seem to hang for a moment in strange patterns before twisting away
into nothing.

"OHODOS - SCIES - ABYSSON!"

The torch flares up with a roar, and the ocean waves seem to respond with
sudden, inexplicable fury, crashing brutally against the island.

The boy cries pitifully, his sobs going unheeded by the chanting cultists and
the raging storm.

>x michael
He is someone else, now, someone you have never known and would never want to
know. His flesh is gaunt; his skin waxy and pale; his forehead burning and
feverish. And his eyes... you can't bear to look into the seething madness of
those wild, red-rimmed eyes. Your husband is gone, now -- some other, alien
force has devoured him from within and now animates his body.

Michael turns his back on the lighthouse, facing out to sea.

"To the East, where the Spawning Chaos seethes and suppurates within the
Crucible of Grum, from whose bursting pustules arise the Million Unseeable
Forms, I summon Thee!"

>x cultists
The throng of cultists presses around the small clearing in the middle of the
island from all directions, chanting, waving torches, and swaying rhythmically
to the terrible beat of whatever monstrous heart lies beneath this island.

Michael makes a quarter-turn to his left.

"To the North, where the Howling Hunger sweeps invisibly across the Yellow
Plains and gnaws upon the entrails of the pious, I summon Thee!"

A monstrous bolt of lightning licks down from the sky and strikes the sea just
north of the island, sending a spume of steam and boiling water fifty feet into
the shrieking sky. Screams of fear and rapture erupt throughout the pressing
crowd, almost inaudible beneath the deafening peal of thunder.

>x stone blocks
The stone is roughly cubical, nearly a foot along each side. There is a thick
iron ring embedded in one side which you are securely handcuffed to.

Michael isn't even fazed. He makes a half-turn to the right and continues:

"To the South, where the Seven Corpulent Sultans of Slaas'tha stand in judgment
over the Heretics of Kron, and force their vile copulations upon the repentant,
I summon Thee!"

Another lightning bolt, this time striking just south of the island, and another
spume of water. The crowd begins to writhe and gibber madly, like a single,
plasmic organism.

>x stake
The wood piled around the base of the stake, and the leather thongs knotted
firmly near the top, make it gruesomely clear that this is no campfire -- it's a
sacrificial pyre.

Michael makes a three-quarter turn to his left, coming all the way around to
face the lighthouse once more.

"To the Ultimate West, wherein lies the Void That Conquers All, I summon Thee!"

The top of the lighthouse begins to glow with an unwholesome, violet light. A
low, ominous vibration creeps up from the ground, crawling up through your bones
and reverberating painfully in your teeth.

>x boy
A skinny, tow-headed boy of eight or so, he bears all the markings of a recent
victim of trauma. His face is smudged with dirt, his wrists are raw and red from
the tight bindings, and his eyes are shadowed with deep, purple half-circles.
For all this, however, you instantly recognize his face from the newspaper
story: it's Jeffrey Greer, the boy who was kidnapped two days ago.

The air around the lighthouse is rippling now. Several cultists fall convulsing
to the mud; others are screaming in strange, strangled tongues. The earth
shakes, and the air is split by a high-pitched harmonic ringing, like a crystal
about to shatter.

Michael raises the torch, preparing to thrust it into the pyre at the child's
feet. He throws his head back and shrieks directly into the eye of the storm:

"IACH! PIOTH XENOBETHAKLES! ULUTUK FH'TAGHN!! BY THE KEYS OF IOK-SOTOT I NAME
THEE!

"!!! IALDABAOLOTH !!! COME FORTH !!!"

>x hands
You can't see any such thing.

Island of Flesh
The island is barely forty feet across, its surface covered with an ankle-deep
layer of slime and muck. Underneath the muck, the ground throbs -- heaving
rhythmically to a blasphemous, living pulse.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

The robed guards hover to either side of you, waiting for you to make a move.

Michael stands in the center of it all, leading the hellish rites.

Robed cultists crowd around on every side -- some of them brandishing flaming
torches, some of them chanting in some hideous, archaic tongue, all of them
swaying to the hypnotic pulse that rises up from the depths of the fleshy
ground.

You are handcuffed to one of several heavy stone blocks set in a rough
semicircle around the center of the island.

Lashed to a stake in the center of the island is a young boy.

What happens next is rather unexpected.

The high-pitched ringing sound reaches a crescendo, and without warning the
upper half of the lighthouse explodes violently in a boiling fireball of violet
flames. For a moment, Michael's lunatic grin of triumph remains frozen in place,
licked by the purple radiance, not yet cognizant that the ritual has gone wrong.
In the next instant, however, he is stricken.

"The mirror..." he whispers hoarsely.

Bits of burning debris are raining down on the island. The cultists fall back in
panic and start pushing at each other to get off the island and escape. Many are
pushed off into the water, where clusters of ropy, jellyfish-like tentacles
immediately drag them screaming beneath the waves. A burning chunk of masonry
strikes one of your guards in the head, and he drops to the mud next to you with
a mass of chewed-spaghetti pulp where his face used to be. The other guard takes
a quick, frightened look around, then bolts without a backward glance.

"Come back!" screams Michael. "Come back, cowards!" But no one heeds him. With a
strangled curse he turns and hurls the torch into the sea.

Your score has just gone up by five points.

>x handcuffs
They're ordinary, police-issue handcuffs. The cuffs are closed.

The horrible, fleshy ground shudders beneath you. Bubbles begin to boil up
around the island's edges.

"You -- " Michael snarls at you, his voice a barely intelligible choke. The
malice pouring out of his expression is almost more than you can bear to look
at. "If I had the time I'd gut you right here and now -- " suddenly the ground
lurches slightly, and Michael smiles. "But perhaps I won't need to." With a
mocking bow he strides past you and hops over to the shore. "I'm sorry I can't
stay around to watch you die," he calls over his shoulder, "but I have some
rather urgent business to attend to." The next moment he is gone, running down
the breakwater toward town.

>x cultists
You can't see any such thing.

>inv
You are wearing a pair of handcuffs, a hooded robe, your clothes and your
wedding ring; in addition, you have in your hands a keyring, on which are nine
keys (a cell key, a long steel key, a tarnished bronze key, a small steel key,
an old-fashioned brass key, a small copper key, an old-fashioned iron key, a key
to the house and a key to the cellar), an amulet and your trenchcoat.

The boiling is becoming more violent. You also notice that the tide seems to be
striking the island a bit higher than before, even though the waves themselves
aren't getting any taller.

The boy cries pitifully, his sobs going unheeded by the chanting cultists and
the raging storm.

>pick handcuffs with needle
(first taking the crusty needle)
The metal cuffs bite painfully into your wrists, but with a little bit of
excruciating contortion you manage to insert the end of the needle into the
keyhole. For what seems like endless minutes, you jiggle the needle fruitlessly
around, biting your lip against the cramps that keep trying to seize your
painfully bent hands and bitterly reflecting that Linda Hamilton makes it look
deceptively easy on the big screen -- and suddenly the cuff snaps open. Quickly
you free your other wrist, and the handcuffs slide free, landing in the muck.

The island is definitely sinking now.

>free boy
Quickly you untie the bonds holding the boy to the stake; as his hands slip free
he jumps away from you and eyes you warily. Then, sniffling and rubbing his
arms, he runs to the edge of the island, hops over onto the breakwater and
starts sprinting home.

Not much time left; the water is lapping up almost to the island's center, and
the gap between the island and the rocky spur is nearly too wide to jump across.

Your score has just gone up by five points.

>w
You hop across the water-filled gap.

Rocky Spur
A small outcropping of stone, just large enough for you to stand on, sticks out
from the end of the breakwater. The hungry sea laps at your feet, surging over
the rocks and then trickling down into crevices. To the southwest, an uneven
trail leads back up the rocks, around the side of the lighthouse.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

Beyond the breakwater's tip, a small island has risen from the sea. It is
quickly sinking back into the churning waters.

With a final, shivering heave, the island of flesh sinks beneath the waves.
Soon, nothing is left except the bubbling, turbulent patch of water.

>save
Ok.

>sw
The trail turns northwest, following the curve of the lighthouse wall.

At the Foot of the Lighthouse
You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every
side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous
pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the
southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down
the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

The great bronze door of the lighthouse stands slightly ajar, revealing a narrow
rectangle of blackness within.

Another wave crashes against the rocks, sending a cloud of spray into the air.

>sw

Breakwater
You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the
road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to
the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of
Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

>w

Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the
south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning
gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in
the other.

>w
As you cross the railroad tracks, the air becomes warmer, more dingy, and
slightly more difficult to breathe.

Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to
the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this
charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south.
To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

>n

Shanty Town
The road peters out at a wide clearing of rutted mud, flanked by uneven rows of
decrepit, clapboard shacks. The town is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits
of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the wind betray the overall stillness.

The young boy you freed from the island is standing here. He gives you a fearful
glance.

Flakes of ash drift gently down from the sky like gray snow, coating everything
with a thin layer of soot, which is quickly washed away by the rain.

>wait
Time passes.

Silently, the boy walks through the churning mud to the front steps of #11 Mill
Town Road. For a moment, he stands there on the stoop, looking back at you;
dirty, disheveled, drenched by the streaming rain. Then he turns and, raising
his little fist, knocks on the door.

The door opens. The old woman looks out, then looks down. She sees the boy, and
it seems that she becomes just a little bit younger at that moment. "My baby..."
you hear her say, and then she is on her knees, folding her son into her arms.
She stands, still holding him, and looks over his shoulder at you.

"Thank you," she says. Her eyes speak volumes of gratitude that her words will
never be able to express. "Thank you for bringing him home."

And then she goes inside, and the door slowly closes behind her.

Entrance to the Paper Mill

To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

>e
As you cross the railroad tracks, the air seems to lift slightly, becoming more
breathable once again.

Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the
south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning
gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in
the other.

A flurry of dead leaves goes skittering along the ground, swirling past you in
the wind.

>s

Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a
country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the
east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make
out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

>e

Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

The rain slackens off momentarily to a weak drizzle, then returns afresh in a
brief, freezing downpour.

>s

Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is
possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

You can see a meat hook here.

>get hook
Your hands are full.

The cold wind blows harder, tugging at your clothes.

>s

Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides
by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this
city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to
the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley
Bridge.

Michael -- or rather, the thing that has possessed Michael's body -- is standing
here.

The poor old man's mutilated corpse hangs from the top of the obelisk.

Michael looks at you and smiles. It is not a particularly pleasant smile. He
walks over to the obelisk and places his hand against the bloodstained stone,
then mutters something guttural under his breath. The twisted hieroglyphs begin
to shine with an eerie phosphorescence which quickly brightens and envelopes
Michael. His form wavers, then becomes transparent, and when the light fades he
has disappeared.

The obelisk is still glowing.

>save
Ok.

>x corpse
The poor man's torn and broken body has been savaged nearly beyond recognition.
You can hardly bear to look at him.

The clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.

The obelisk is still glowing.

>touch obelisk
As your fingers touch the gore-streaked stone, the green light grows brighter,
fanning out to envelope you. The odor of rotting fruit briefly assails your
nostrils; your vision streaks, then blurs; there is the sound of rushing air,
and when your eyes clear, you are somewhere else...

Burial Mound
The cave is lined, floor to ceiling, with mummified human corpses. Shrunken and
desiccated, they lie in jumbled heaps inside irregularly carved niches. Carvings
cover the rock walls in between the niches -- grotesque, leering faces too
horrible even to look upon, their features twitching and smirking in the
wavering light that sifts down from above.

Michael -- or rather, the thing that has possessed Michael's body -- is standing
here.

The obelisk base stands before you, vast and shadowy in the green, murky light.

At the narrower, northern end of the vaguely egg-shaped cavern sits a massive
stone altar, flanked on either side by a pair of strange, vibrating columns.

Suddenly Michael lunges forward and grabs your arms. He shakes you, causing your
head to whip back and forth and your teeth to click painfully together.

"Bitch -- " he hisses, " -- rotten, filthy bitch -- you never give up, do you?
You've foiled me for the last time! There's no way to fix what you've undone
tonight, but by all the unholy spawn of darkness I will put you in a stone cold
place for it!!" And his hands lock tightly around your throat and begin to
squeeze.

>show ring to michael
There is one chance -- if you can only somehow reach whatever weak flicker of
humanity still survives within that shell; if the person who was your husband
still exists somewhere, buried beneath the part that is Croseus Verlac...

Silently, you raise up your left hand, your wedding ring gleaming softly in the
strange, green light.

Michael is transfixed. He seems to want to recoil from the sight, yet is somehow
simultaneously drawn to it. Suddenly, his face crumbles, the madness and stoic
evil falling away to reveal confusion, fear, vulnerability and anguish -- all
superimposed upon the malevolent features of Croseus, struggling to regain
control.

Your score has just gone up by five points.

>show amulet to michael
In his moment of hesitation, you see your chance; straining against his choking
grip, you slip the amulet's cord around Michael's neck, letting the silver
pendant drop to his chest.

Instantly Michael begins convulsing, arching his back and clawing at his chest.
His jaws stretch open as if to release a howl of torment, but instead of voice,
a thick, ropy stream of ectoplasmic mist pours from his throat. It pools into
the center of the room, roils about, then coalesces into a human form -- the
vaporous, half-rotted apparition of Croseus Verlac himself!

Your score has just gone up by five points.

>get flute
(the strange metal flute)
Taken.

Michael lets out a weak groan.

>cover hole 1
You place your finger over the first flute hole.

The ghost lets out a chilling, sepulchral laugh. "You useless, puny mortal," it
cries. "Did you really think that there was any way on earth you could stop me?
I have lived and thrived for over four hundred years -- not even Death can claim
me!"

>cover hole 7
You place your finger over the seventh flute hole.

"You sabotaged my dimensional beacon -- I will build another. You drove me from
my host body -- I will find another. What next? Will you track down my
disciples, one by one, and kill them all? Will you set this whole town to the
torch?"

Michael is doubled over with racking coughs, bringing up a thin trickle of
blood.

>play flute
(the strange metal flute)
The flute emits an odd mixture of metallic, warbling notes which intertwine and
harmonize eerily with each other.

The strange harmony of the flute blends with the atonal ringing of the two
columns, and the three sounds suddenly grow stronger, resonating with and
reinforcing one another, intertwining like a dissonant, invisible braid. The
sound increases in volume, piercing your eardrums and causing the very air to
shimmer.

Suddenly the air above the altar begins to ripple as though with extreme heat.
The very fabric of space seems to twist and buckle between the two columns; and
then, with a sound like a wet sheet being torn slowly down the middle, the
fabric splits.

You are immediately swept off your feet by a powerful sucking vacuum, pulling
everything within reach toward the portal. Dust and debris; bones and loose rock
from the burial niches; everything not nailed down goes flying across the temple
and into the all-devouring maw hovering over the altar-stone. Desperately, you
wedge your fingers into a crack in the floor; with the other hand you grasp hold
of Michael's pants leg and hang on for dear life.

Verlac is caught like a gossamer thread in a tornado. Frantically he claws at
the air, but as an insubstantial ghost there is nothing for him to hang on to.
Shrieking and cursing, he is dragged inexorably back, closer and closer to the
portal, until the suction draws his corpus out into a long, trailing ribbon,
like an unraveling cable-knit sweater -- and in the next moment he is gone
forever, sucked into whatever alien dimension lies beyond that horrible rift.

For a few agonizing moments you don't think you're going to make it; then,
suddenly, the chaos stops, leaving you breathless on the floor.

Painstakingly, you pry your stiff, bleeding fingers out of the crack and roll
over. The rift is gone. The air is normal, and the columns are ringing quietly,
as if nothing had happened.

Silence reigns.

There passes some time that your memory cannot account for; a brief period of
blackness and oblivion, you and your unconscious husband, together in the
subterranean vault. Perhaps you were unconscious as well; you cannot remember.
At some point you become conscious again. You lift Michael to his feet, putting
his arm around your shoulders, and the two of you stagger up the titan stairs to
the surface. The ground begins rumbling just as you are exiting the house, but
by that time Michael has recovered some of his senses and can walk a bit faster.

You make it down to the bend in the road overlooking the town just in time to
see the town square collapse, the vile obelisk sinking into the earth. Several
buildings are dragged down along with it. A gas pipe ruptures in the courthouse,
sending a gout of flame high into the air, and soon the entire town is burning.

Behind you, a muffled explosion and a sudden warmth against your back bespeak a
similar end to the Verlac family mansion. For a moment you find yourself almost
turning back, driven by instinct to rescue your belongings -- but you stop. You
turn away. And while Michael rests, you stand at the overlook and watch the
sparks rise like fireflies, mingling with the stars in a clear, cloudless sky.




[          * EPILOGUE *

He always returns to his blood.

-- Edward Verlac]







Home
You are home, and it is a momentous event. Downstairs, Michael is waiting for
you to bring him the wondrous news. To the east is the bedroom you both share,
and to the north is your bathroom.

A cool wave of uneasiness washes slowly over you; you're not sure why.

Your score has just gone up by fifteen points.

>e
There's nothing important in the bedroom at the moment.

"Well?" Michael calls excitedly from downstairs. "Have you looked yet?"

>d
You don't want to go downstairs until you have something to tell Michael.

Michael calls up again, this time sounding slightly worried: "Hon? Everything
okay up there?"

>tell michael okay
You can't see any such thing.

>say I'm okay
(to yourself)
Talking to yourself is a sure sign of impending mental collapse.

A nameless, formless apprehension grips you suddenly, leaving you short of
breath. Why are you so frightened, on what should be such a joyous occasion?

You can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.

>x fly
You can't see where the fly is. You're not even sure where the buzzing is coming
from.

>n
You can barely feel yourself walking; it's almost as if some outer force were
moving you of its own accord.

Your bathroom; an ordinary place. A normal, safe, familiar place.

On the counter is a home pregnancy test.

>x counter

>get test
You pick up the home pregnancy test. It's an ordinary pregnancy test, the kind
you can get at any drugstore; the kind with the little window that turns pink if
you're going to have a baby.

>x test

>look in little window
You find nothing of interest.

>look at little window
You stare down at the little plastic indicator, and an inexplicable horror
seizes you as you recall Edward Verlac's last words:

And besides; who could say whether the crafty devil Croseus might not concoct
some new way to enter the world, through a new body -- through that of one of my
daughters, perhaps? The ritual has always demanded a grandson, but Croseus was
never one to let such a trivial inconvenience stop him. He would find a way. He
always returns to his blood.

The window is pink. The test is positive.

From downstairs, you can hear Michael joyfully talking to himself:

"Oh, I hope it's a little girl," he says. "I've always wanted to have a little
girl."

Of course, you have already surmised that there are many creative ways in which
you can die in this game. Whether or not you find that particularly amusing...
well, that's between you and your conscience. I, for one, found them amusing to
code; perhaps you will find them amusing to experience.

Do not attempt the following at home:

- standing on the train tracks until the train comes.
- standing on the altar while you blow the flute.
- wandering around the Narrow Aisles adjacent to the Mill Floor for too long.

- not giving Michael the mirror when he asks for it.
- letting Michael die before you destroy Croseus.
- reading the big black book in the abandoned church -- in its entirety.
- EXAMINING William Verlac.
- ATTACKING Michael with the meat hook.
- allowing the summoning ritual to proceed to its conclusion without
sabotaging the beacon first.

Did you try just typing LISTEN while Michael is in the shower on the morning of
Day 2? Type it several times.

Did you take a good look at the paintings in the gallery? One scene in
particular will catch your eye. EXAMINE the scene. Leave the room and come back
later, and EXAMINE the paintings again.

In Claudia Benson's last letter, she mentions that she did some research at the
Miskatonic library. Did you try looking her name up on the circulation register?
You might find some interesting reading material.

You may have noticed that your appearance changes as the game progresses and you
get more and more filthy. Did you try EXAMINING yourself while wearing the
strait jacket? How about talking to yourself?

Also, did you EXAMINE yourself during the epilogue?

Did you try SCREAMING or CRYING? Did you try it while handcuffed to the island
at the end of Chapter Four?

If you wait around for a while at the Twisting Lane or the Rocky Spur, you might
catch something interesting. You might have to wait a long time, though.

Did you try typing XYZZY? No? Good.

Several puzzles in Anchorhead admit more than one solution; some even boast more
than two. Many of these alternate solutions are actually "second chances" that
pop up elsewhere in the story, should you happen to miss the narrow window of
oppourtunity provided to solve the puzzle the first time. Although my caveat
about saving in "About This Game" still holds, there are actually few mistakes
in Anchorhead that are truly irreversible (other than the immediately fatal
ones, of course).

You might find it interesting to go back and see if you can find other ways to:

- discover the name "Verlac".
- clear away the spiderweb in the cellar.
- get the brass key from the attic cell.
- obtain Michael's faculty card.
- open the puzzle box.
- reach the bottom riser from the church basement.
- spy on Michael on the morning of the third day.
- turn the steam-release wheel.
- get up to the mill catwalk.
- open the real estate agent's desk drawer.
- safely witness the old bum's murder.
- get rid of the madman in Danvers Asylum.

These quotes are taken from actual bug reports from the first version of
Anchorhead. Names have been obscured to embarrass the guilty.

2nd PRIZE:

"Obscure fact: Edward writes that he pricked the inside of his cheek to draw
blood for his ink. The inside of the cheek isn't a good choice for an inkwell,
since it's mighty difficult to get it to bleed. Have you bitten your cheek while
chewing food? It hurts, but it doesn't bleed. Have you seen body manipulators
pierce their cheeks with a metal skewer? They choose the cheek precisely because
it won't bleed. You can try this at home yourself with a needle or a large
safety pin. Sterilize it, psyche yourself up, and pierce the cheek from the
inside to the outside. It's *very* disconcerting, but it's not painful, and if
there's any blood at all, it will bleed from the *outside* of the cheek, not the
inside."

1st PRIZE:

"This is horrible, but I got really confused at the epilogue, because I thought
I hadn't taken the pregnancy test yet. (It's amazing how difficult it is to
express taking a pregnancy test in IF commands.)"

Circulation Desk
A high counter divides the public portion of the library from the reserved
stacks -- all the more esoteric and mysterious volumes from the university's
collection. If anything, the area behind the counter is even more shadowy than
the side you're on. The main reading area lies south.

Hanging on the wall next to the counter is a small, printed sign. Beneath the
sign sits a heavy, dog-eared register, and sitting next to the register is a
bell.

>look up benson
(in the dog-eared register)
Claudia Benson's name is up near the top of the page. She has checked out
several books in the last few weeks: A Historical Overview of Superstitions in
the Miskaton Valley Region by J. Arnsworth Frazer; The Righteous Invasion: a
History of Indian/Settler Conflicts in the Colonial Period by Warner Greene;
Mechanics of Metempsychosis by C. C. H. Horne; and N-Fold Transduction and the
Space-Time Barrier: a New Theory in Particle Physics by Lord Wheldrake. Strange;
you can't help but wonder why your real estate agent would have amassed such an
esoteric reading list.

A moment later, the gaunt and fishy-eyed librarian emerges silently from the
shadows behind the counter.

>ask librarian for greene
Wordlessly the librarian retreats back into the shadows, only to reappear the
next moment carrying the book you requested. Dutifully, you sign the register,
and the librarian hands you the book before disappearing again.

>read greene
Its full title is The Righteous Invasion: a History of Indian/Settler Conflicts
in the Colonial Period by Warner Greene. It's a slim volume, published by
Miskaton Press in 1943. According to the introduction, the book's purpose is to
give an objective account of the social and economic factors which led some of
the early American colonies into violent conflict with the tribes of the
northeast, concluding with a transitional discussion of how the "Indian
policies" which took shape early on evolved into Western Expansionism and the
idea of Manifest Destiny. The author, reflecting the more conservative decade in
which he wrote, tends to paint a more sympathetic picture of the European side
of the issue than would be fashionable today; but all in all it seems an
intelligent, thoughtful analysis.

Glancing through the table of contents, you notice that there is a short chapter
on the Misquat Indians. Curious, you flip to the page.

The fate of the Misquat tribe, states the author, is an enigma which may never
be solved. Diplomatic relationships with the original river valley settlers
seemed doomed from the beginning. Documents from the period paint the tribe as
aggressively pagan, degenerate savages. Nevertheless, Croseus Verlac managed to
hammer out a peace treaty of sorts with the tribal leader, and the two groups
led an uneasy coexistence for over a century.

The exact circumstances which led up to the "battle" of Quattac Bend in 1772 are
unclear. One document makes mention of an "uprising", although since as far as
is known, the Misquats were never in a subservient relationship to the
Anchorhead settlers, the use of this term is more puzzling than revealing. In
fact, no evidence has yet been discovered that corroborates the notion that the
Misquat Indians initiated any sort of hostility whatsoever.

What is known is this: the Battle of Quattac Bend took place in the dead of
night. It was led by Croseus' descendant, Heinrich Verlac, and "fought" by some
twenty town men, who crept through the woods and ambushed the small tribe during
one of its holy ceremonies. There are no lists of casualties. Although the diary
of one soldier tells of many prisoners being taken, there is no mention of where
these prisoners were kept or what was eventually done to them.

No known document makes even the vaguest allusion to the Misquat Indians after
1772. From that date onward, the tribe effectively ceases to exist.

A moment later, the gaunt and fishy-eyed librarian emerges silently from the
shadows behind the counter.

>ask librarian for horne
The librarian gives you a fishy look. Apparently, you are only allowed one book
at a time.

Wordlessly the librarian takes the tome from you and spirits it back to the

and the librarian hands you the book before disappearing again.

>read horne
According to the author's foreword, the term "metempsychosis" means the
transmigration of souls -- that is, the reincarnation of a soul into another
body. The book, which was published in 1922, is an examination of various
traditions' explanations of how and why this happens. The author's tone is very
matter-of-fact; it's unclear whether he is approaching the subject from the
standpoint of a mythologist or if he actually believes in reincarnation and is
evaluating the various theories based on their "scientific" validity.

Flipping through the book, you find a passage that has been highlighted:

"Among tribes with a strong ancestor-worship tradition, one often discovers the
quaint notion that one may be reincarnated as one's own descendant. Asking such
people whether they must share a single body with the spirit of their ancestor
(inheritance), or if they themselves are in essence their own grandfather
(identity), is generally futile; among primitives, concepts of self-identity are
poorly defined at best. Often there exists no word in their native language to
express the idea. One can assume, however, that the primitive tribesman's
conception of the situation is probably closer to the latter option; otherwise,
over the course of generations one would have to contend with dozens of
ancestral spirits fighting for room within a single body. However, the theory of
identity also begs the question: how far back does the chain of reincarnation
go? One could conceivably be dealing with a tribe of 'first' men, present at the
day of Creation and renewing themselves over the aeons with each succeeding
generation."

Wordlessly the librarian retreats back into the shadows, only to reappear the
next moment carrying the book you requested. Dutifully, you sign the register,
and the librarian hands you the book before disappearing again.

>read wheldrake
This is a very thin volume, more of a tract than a proper book. You notice with
some interest that it was published in 1918 by Miskaton University Press, though
who "Lord Wheldrake" was you cannot begin to fathom.

Even without a background in physics, you can immediately tell that this is
nothing but the purest pseudoscience. The author claims to have made "startling
advances" relating to a heretofore unknown medium through which energy can
travel. As far as you can tell, he performed no actual experiments; his entire
thesis is built on extrapolation from his own creative reasoning. One bit near
the middle has been marked with a highlighter:

"Having established the existence of the N-space medium, we can then reasonably
posit the existence of a special wave-length capable of traveling through that
medium; we will call this form of energy, appropriately enough, N-rays. Due to
the fundamentally extradimensional nature of N-space, N-rays cannot logically be
located at any one point of the electromagentic spectrum; they instead exist at
every point along the spectrum, traveling perpendicular it. Naturally, the
practical ramifications of being able to transmit extradimensionally are dwarfed
by the theoretical implications..."

Good grief, you can't help thinking. What drivel.

(first opening the iron-barred gate)
You shouldn't be able to open it, heavy as it is, but it swings aside lightly at your touch. The Beast said that it knows friend from enemy; and the castle, at least, still regards you as friend.

Entrance Hall
There is no fire in the big fireplace, and no one is waiting for you here; the air is very cold. Over the gate, the old familiar warning sign is painted.

Various passages lead deeper into the castle: north towards the central courtyard, southwest to the guard tower, east and west into the libraries, the offices, the galleries. Somewhere in this maze, he waits; and he should be told as soon as possible that you did return.

An iron-barred gate leads south to the drawbridge.

Great Dining Hall
Such a long hall that the soup might get cold between one end and the other. You and he used only the far west end, nearest the kitchen. Once you took to dining together at all, that is; the first few months he brought trays to your room, while you hid.

But then you took to eating here; and at the end of every meal he would stand up formally and ask his question.

"You can leave at any time," he said, when he first spoke to you. You stared at him, surprised that someone with his face and teeth was capable of human communication. "Would you like to go?"

There are other memories, more recent, of course. Every glance around the room reminds you of a different one.

>look

You allow yourself to remember another night, another request.

"I'm surprised you haven't gone home yet," he said very early in your stay.

"I've heard stories," you replied. "As if there weren't enough to see around the castle. I know what happens to your servants who try to leave you."

"Nothing bad would happen to you," he said. But you could not believe him, not with all the captured spirits, not with the stories, not with the evidence around the castle.

>look

"And now -- would you like to go home?"

You bit your lip. It had been a pleasant conversation, up until now, when you are reminded: however nicely he may behave, he is still the king of a cursed line, and not to be trusted.

>look

"I assure you," he added. "No harm will come to you if you do go."

"I only have your word for that," you replied, looking stubbornly into your soupbowl.

He sat. "I am unable to lie to you," he said. "It is one of the conditions placed upon us. We can only tell the truth."

"And why should I believe that?"

He raised his glass. "I'll try again tomorrow."

>look
Great Dining Hall
You allow yourself to remember another night, another request.

"Were you ever married?" you asked, ignoring his question.

"No."

"Then you have no heirs?"

"I have no legitimate sons," he replied. "But I certainly have an heir, somewhere. If I died, somewhere, someone would inherit all this, and the whole system would go on as before, the servants and the contracts. But don't worry: I have tried, and it turns out that I don't die easily."

>look

"And you promise I would not regret it? Truthfully."

He coughed. "I don't know your future. And -- since you ask I must answer -- I don't think much of your father, a man who would barter his daughter's service for his own, especially since he had unflattering ideas of what I would do with you."

You sputtered. "Well of course you couldn't-- I mean, being an animal..."

His teeth gleamed. "I assure you I could," he said. "But I won't."

>look

"I have become used to it here," you answered, surprising yourself. "There is plenty to read; there is the chessman, and games; and you are good company." He raised his glass with a half smile. "You'd rather stay here without me?"

"No," he said.

>look

You allow yourself to remember another night, another request.

"I c-care for you," you said. "I am lonely without you, and you make me laugh, and you're nice..."

"Stop," he said. "And remind me never to order the port again."

He picked you up from your chair and your head rested on his shoulder. "But why can I not be in love... Oh, carry me carefully on the stairs: I feel sick!"

"Simply, pet," he said, walking slowly up the steps. "What you offer I couldn't accept. In fact, I'm not sure what you are offering. Do you have some fantasy of marrying me? Being my mistress?"

You could not think of the answer; there was no solution that was not absurd. He set you down carefully on the bed and went away. A moment later he came back, bright crimson bell in his left paw. "When you wake in the morning and are very ill, which you will be, ring this and the servants will bring a tonic appropriate to your condition."

>look

You allow yourself to remember another night, another request.

"For a visit, if you won't go to stay?" he asked. "We could arrange that too, if you liked."

"And nothing bad would happen to anyone I cared about?" you demanded.

"Nothing bad would happen to you or to your family. There would be no ill health and no spiritual repercussions."

"You're leaving something out," you said, having gotten familiar with the precise way he speaks when hedging around a difficult fact.

"It could be unpleasant for me," he replied, strained. "But you mustn't stay because of my feelings on the matter. Your family miss you, and I am the villain in this piece."

>look

"Don't mention the leaving thing once more," you said. "Or I will throw a glass at your head."

He sighed. "You are as stubborn as you are honorable," he said. "No doubt the two are related."

>look

You allow yourself to remember another night, another request.

After a long time: "You haven't asked me to leave in a while," you said.

"Ah." He looked at his plate of food. "Of course you may go. I'm glad you believe my word about the effects, now."

"I will go to visit my family," you say, stressing the word visit. "On condition that you tell me how to do it so that I will not harm you. If you won't do that, I don't go."

He looked at you, his expression cloudy. "There is a very good reason why..."

"Those are my terms."

He sighed. "Very well," he said. "If your trip lasts fewer than seven days, it will have no effect on anything here." He looked down at his curled paw. "But if you don't come back -- and I imagine you won't -- I will forgive you."

There is no fire in the big fireplace; the air is very cold. Over the gate, the old familiar warning sign is painted.

Various passages lead deeper into the castle: north towards the central courtyard, southwest to the guard tower, east and west into the libraries, the offices, the galleries. Somewhere in this maze, he waits; and he should be told as soon as possible that you did return.

An iron-barred gate leads south to the drawbridge.

>n

Central Courtyard
Open to a grey sky, from which a light rain falls. You have never seen the courtyard otherwise: it rains in every season, winter or summer, no matter what lies beyond the moat.

It was here that you first laid eyes on the Beast: emerging from the State Rooms, snarling. He seemed angry at you for coming, even though you had had no choice. Or perhaps (you thought) he was simply violent. You did not run.

The castle proper opens both north and south, and to the east a helical staircase ascends to the roof.

>x rain
The raindrops seem to you larger and colder than you remember.

>x staircase
A handsome staircase designed by an Italian engineer in the 16th century.

>e

Ground Floor Helical Staircase
The steps rise from here towards the upper rooms, and open out onto the bare courtyard.

An obscene gargoyle sits where the finial of the banister should be.

Upstairs. That must be the solution. You'll find him up there, and everything will go back to normal; as it always does after a fight or disagreement or odd patch. Sooner or later things just right themselves and resume as they have always gone.

>x gargoyle
He came up while you were bent over the gargoyle, trying to lift it. "Taking that back to your room?" he asked slyly. "It won't work, but if you're lacking companionship I could find an appropriate servant to see to your needs."

You felt yourself blush. "It's ugly," you said. "I wanted to move it."

"Oh. You can't." He frowned at it. "It is a remnant, left here by an angry soul who managed to take some revenge despite his enslavement. There are a few others around, mostly in the crypt. They're immovable, but harmless."

You reacquaint yourself with its appearance: Not too large, but stunningly ugly: a stone about the size of an apple, carved into a monster with outsized ears and eyes -- not to mention outsized attributes elsewhere.

>u

Upstairs Helical Staircase
In this spot, you fell and almost broke your leg -- or some other more valuable part of you -- except that He caught you.

But you are alone now, and therefore cautious.

Private Parlor
A sitting room of the family, in old times, and familiar territory to you now as well. Your bedroom is just south; other bedrooms, mostly smaller, in other directions.

Nearby a heavy door leads north.

You can also see a bentwood table (on which is a jigsaw puzzle) here.

>x puzzle
His latest offering: he brings you all the most innocent toys he can find, to occupy your time and make you less miserable. This one is nearly finished, missing only one piece that neither of you could ever find.

>x table
The appearance of the bentwood table has not changed significantly since you left.

On the bentwood table is a jigsaw puzzle.

Crystal Bedroom
A fantasia of gleaming and glittering, chandeliers and mirrors: all that shines or reflects has been moved here, into this room that you inhabit, which he never enters.

The south end of the room is most dazzling, because of the daylight from the balcony.

>x mirrors
You learned, long ago, that the mirrors would keep him away; and then, when you had less need to keep him at bay, you kept them anyway, so as not to disturb him by returning them to the rest of the palace.

>s
You step out into the rain; the fat droplets sound like hail on the surface of your helmet.

Gilded Balcony
A ridiculous filigreed balcony that is like nothing so much as a birdcage: and from here you can see all the way across the moat, across the forest, the plain, to the edge of the sea, only by staring long enough in any direction.

When you first came here, the balcony was full of plants in pots: poison oak, nettles, nightshade, datura. "They grow best here," he explained. "Don't touch them." And he took them away, and you have never seen them again since.

>x sea
If you look long enough, your vision expands until you can see the ocean, grey and clouded with storms, that took your father's livelihood and brought your family to ruin.

Green Bedroom
Having more personality than most of the bedrooms, it was decorated for someone specific and has been left that way: green and white, with a simple rustic cast unusual for the palace.

The chief exception is the royal portrait on the wall.

>x portrait
"That was me," he told you. "Before I was changed. Do you think I was handsome?"

You shrugged. Handsome, yes, but proud, selfish, resentful, perhaps cruel. "The painter did not do justice to your personality," you replied.

"You're wrong," he said. "And I put the painting here to punish the woman who slept here. She treated me with justice, and I could not forgive her."

He refused to tell you the rest. "You like me more than you should, and trust me less," he said. "If I told you the rest of this particular story, you would neither trust nor like. There, that's a warning for you."

You reacquaint yourself with its appearance: A portrait of a young, arrogant king: not a prince, but one who inherited early and used his power from the beginning. He stares out with bitterness, perhaps even resentment.

Empty Bedroom
Like a monk's chamber compared to every other part of the palace, just bare walls now. Here your father stayed, when he made his ill-fated journey to the castle. The Beast told you this, on your first visit.

On the wall, as a curio, hangs an open shackle -- sign of the only person ever to have escaped the power of this place.

>x shackle
Your father claims to have been chained up, but the Beast never made the least effort to restrain you with chains or bars. On the contrary-- but that remains a puzzle.

You reacquaint yourself with its appearance: A curious object, a broken shackle. Nowhere else in the castle are there any chains or ropes or devices of torture; there has never been a need for such physical coercion...

Guest Bedroom
Made up for the reception of a guest who will never arrive again. A tapestry recalls the story.

Still here at the center of the room is the stool you and the Beast used, the time he tried to teach you to dance -- not a great success, but more effective than the experiment with stilts.

He's not upstairs, then: there's nowhere in these rooms he could have been hiding, no space large enough to conceal him.

He must have gone into one of the more... difficult portions of the castle. The state rooms, or the crypt. One of the places he knows you hate to visit alone.

This does not bode well for his state of mind. (Will he be angry? It has been a long time since he was truly angry at you... But you cannot deal with that until you find him.)

>x tapestry
It is hard to make out the story from the faded threads, but it appears to show a very small man, almost a dwarf, who holds on a leading string a very large demon, almost a god.

A few weeks ago now, he came to you with a quick step. "Look, it took me all morning, but I found this." Holding out the basket of threads, the folded linen. Not in bad condition, either.

"What is that for?" You were never much for sewing things at home, even before your mother died.

"I thought -- since you're so bored here --" He lowered his arm. "When I saw more of the world, I knew a number of young ladies who were very fond of it. My sister liked to make stories with hers."

You opened your mouth, looking for something to say.

"I see," he answered. "The world has changed. What do young ladies do now?"

"I don't know," you reply. "My father fell on hard times. We live in the country. I'm more or less a milkmaid, these days."

At the word milkmaid, his mouth twisted a little and he shrugged. "I cannot provide any cows," he said, after a long time.

A hole in the floor descends to the other, less savory portion of this place.

You can see a great contract book here.

>x books
Which do you mean, the books or the books of precedent?

>the books of precedent
There are too many for you to read even if you took a long time at it, and most are written in unfamiliar languages.

>x great contract book
The runes are unfamiliar to you, but you know what the book is: a record of all the contracts of all the souls enslaved to the king of this castle.

You caught him staring at you once. "Your clothing is wearing out. I'll look up a seamstress in the contract book for you."

You plucked the erring sleeve back into place. "You needn't," you said. "I don't mind."

"Yes, but I do," he snapped. "I was once a -- the polite term would be a connoisseur of ladies -- and it is not a taste that goes away. So for everyone's sanity it would be best if you went about fully clothed."

You avoided him for three days, after that incident. But your gowns were all replaced.

Lower Bulb
In this very tall room, like a silo, is a glass of running sand: not an hourglass, or even a dayglass, but a timer whose duration you do not know. A whole Sahara has poured into its lower chamber, but the trickle from above continues, very fine.

Around the outside of this contraption ascends a wooden staircase.

Upper Bulb
In the upper chamber, you find, there is almost as much sand as there is below; indeed for all you can tell the flow might be eternal.

Nearby an ivory door leads southwest.

And here Beast lies, sprawled on the ground as if he'd fallen.

"Nothing bad will happen for the first seven days," he said, when you left.

And yet here he is, looking very nearly dead.

>x beast
He looks starved, unwell, near death, in fact. He will need to be given food before he will properly revive -- and who knows what else...

It baffles you to find him in this condition, when he could easily have gotten whatever he needed in the kitchen.

Gallery of Still Life
Natural light from the south -- coming in from the courtyard, you suppose, though you are too short to see out -- illuminates a series of still life paintings on the north wall: one showing the Wedding Treasure when Lucrezia arrived from Medici-Credenza, the other rather fancifully entitled Supper with M.

Nearby a heavy door leads east.

>x wedding
A table tastefully laid with possessions of power or personal worth, brought by Lucrezia as gifts from her father: an inkpot, a helmet, a green girdle stitched with vines, a curious pair of cloven shoes.

You get far enough to glimpse a mechanical chessplayer before being overcome: you reel back from a smell of roses and death, so powerful that you can't go forward. Until there's a breeze through here, you won't be able to stand being in the place.

Gallery of Historical Paintings
Here on the north wall and the south are paintings of historical events from times past: the assassination of King Elzibad in 1248; the arrival of Princess Lucrezia from the Italian State of Medici-Credenza in 1545.

The gallery goes on, echoing, both east and west.

You quickly skim the unpleasant history of Lucrezia of Medici-Credenza, how she brought odd magical treasures with her, introduced new methods of binding and contracting that were previously unknown even to this castle, and maintained a room for her studies in the basement below the rose garden. From this room everyone including her husband was banned.

There are some suggestions that she was the daughter of the Devil himself, sent to the castle to tempt the kings into further folly and destruction. But who knows?

>consult papers about devil
A very old scroll narrates how King Athanasius, first of his line, entered a wager with Mephistopheles, and won the pen that the Devil used to sign contracts for men's souls.

The King retired to this castle, overjoyed with his success, but the Devil flew away laughing.

The chessplayer wears a turban, and in its wooden fingers grasps the head of the black bishop. Whatever move it contemplates has yet to occur.

The Beast brought it out for you to play against, when other entertainment palled. You lost consistently until he came and roared at it; and afterwards began to win. The suspicion that it was throwing games made you a bit reluctant to make use of it, in the end.

Perhaps he will feel better when he has eaten, you reflect. He has always had a large appetite -- the result of his change in form, he tells you.

With great care, you feed the soup to the Beast. So much spills that you doubt whether you are making any progress; then he swallows.

"You are ornery," he says. "I guaranteed your return -- you know what that means?"

"That if I had not come back, you would have died," you reply.

"That is only a small part of what would have happened. The other contracts would have unraveled, the servant souls freed."

You frown at him. "I've been trying to use you to this purpose for years," he says, touching your cheek. "But you wouldn't go. I'm touched that you came back for me -- really, I can't tell you how much -- but you've ruined the plan."

"Is there a way to set them free that doesn't kill you?" you ask.

He looks startled. "Not for me," he says. "There's a room in the basement below the rose garden I can't get into. Lucrezia's room. You'll need to get in, search the crypt, find a way to destroy the contracts book... there are places in the castle I cannot enter, because she sealed them against all her descendants. But you are not one of her descendants, so--" He chuckles weakly at some joke, but he hands you an iron key. "You'll need the shoes."

"Would that lift the curse on you, too, do you think?" you ask.

Your father's contract is just before your own: a lifetime (and deathtime) of service in this castle, as the immediate result of setting foot herein. From comparison to some of the other contracts, you see that it would have been easy service indeed, no manual labor but only companionship to the king, and no command-bell to make him come or go.

But the contract has been amended in a small neat hand that says: "Voided in voluntary exchange for his daughter's service." That would be where you come in. And: "Guarantor of this exchange: the king of the castle and all his rights and servants."

Built for the bureaucratic offices of the palace. Inlaid in the floor is the map of all the lands that once this palace commanded; and from the stains and driblets of wax, it is clear to you that someone at some time thought it useful to set a candle at the map's center, and observe the result.

>put candle in map
That can't contain things.

>put candle on map
You set down the candle.

>x map
Since the lands of the Kingdom were once quite dispersed the cartographer has, from indolence, fancy, or an urge to flatter, omitted all the territories that intervened, so that here floating in a cherry-wood sea are the State of Medici-Credenza; the Emirate of Elzibad; the Equine Protectorate of Argos; a goodly portion of Essex; and Malta, the only true island of the lot. Of these, the candle's light glows with particular strength only in Italy and Malta; it seems that the power of the Kingdom has waned a good deal.

You read: Here there be Daemons.

>get candle
You acquire the candle.

>go to rose garden
You head east to the parliamentary chambers. Then east to cloister walk. And finally north to rose garden.

Rose Garden
Only one kind of rose grows here, a pink only just distinct from white. This strain creeps over the ground and climbs the walls of the cloister.

In the middle of the garden a way slopes into the ground, reminding you of the entrance to a burial mound.

>d

Rooted Room
Cut as an afterthought through earth and the underside of the garden, and therefore muddy and soil-scented.

>wear helmet
You settle the helmet over your head, and there is a roaring in your ears at first. But then the sharpened hearing begins to feel natural again.

Bell Castings
A room of scrap and refuse: wooden structures and clay molds from which bells might be made, scrap metal, pieces of bells now broken.

Zoo
A resting place for an animal: warm but rough. There is little to suggest, from this environment, that he thinks of himself as a man at all, though he is capable of walking upright and eating with utensils, of reading books and even of writing a legible hand.

The only distinguishing mark is a miniature hung on the wall, like a devotional object, or perhaps a reminder. Something about the sole image in an otherwise bare room reminds you of the royal portrait in the Green Bedroom.

You can see a poison vial here.

>x miniature
The tiny image of a lady in a green girdle. But it isn't Lucrezia.

>get vial
You acquire the poison vial, and assess it curiously.

You brought it with you; he confiscated it the first night.

"It was a good thought," he said, plucking it from your fingers with a delicacy that should be impossible in one his size. "But if I could be killed by poison -- or by violence, or starving, or leaping from towers, by drowning or by suffocation or by fire, I assure you, I would have found the way by now. That leaves only yourself as a victim, and I did not bring you here to die." And so you didn't.

You reacquaint yourself with its appearance: It has mostly dried up now; the apothecary who sold it to you did not say anything about whether it would keep its efficacy for long.

>x vial

Bear Corridor
Less couth and cultivated than any other part of the castle, and you have been forbidden to visit this place before now. The walls press close to you on either side. The floor slopes down. Bears with sharp claws are carved into the rock, but they remind you of Him, and you are not frightened.

>u

Room with the Labyrinth Floor
A mosaic floor of black and white, like that of cathedrals, as protection against the spite of the undead: which protection might often have been needed, by those that dwelt here in former times. The way down is at the center of the maze.

The maze doesn't look uncrossable by you. You step forward and look down into the room below, but it is too dark to see much.

A tight, rocky corner among foundations of the oldest part of the castle. A slow leak in the south wall admits a little water, but not enough to be very destructive.

You start into the crypt, but an icy unnatural wind blows against you, as though the spirits resent the intrusion of someone with a light. And yet you have seen the Beast come down here, from time to time, bearing lanterns, torches, whatever he found handy.

Darkness
It's very dark and you can barely make out any of the room's contents, or even tell where the walls are. The only illumination is a harsh raking light across the floor, coming in from the northeast.

The inscription is unfortunately just too high on the wall to be fully lit this way, though you can pick up part of it.

>x inscription
There's lettering beneath the pullcord.

The light coming in does illuminate the floor sharply, and is at a good angle, but it is a bit too low to show up the lettering halfway up the wall. All you get is the deepest capital letters -- P, L, and D -- and the last line: or he will depart again without offering aid.

You put the candle on the stool, aligning it neatly against the wall. A harsh raking illumination is now cast along the wall, about at a height with your knees.

The light from northeast comes in a bit above floor-level, sharply illuminating one wall but leaving the rest of your surroundings dark and unfathomable.

The inscription stands out beautifully now.

It says a few words in the bastardized Italian of the state of Medici-Credenza, and you hear the scrape of wood and stone from somewhere below you: a door opening.

Then the presence vanishes.

Simply flipping through them with no particular goal in mind is inexplicably disquieting to you, as though you might learn a maddening truth if you are not extremely cautious.

>consult notes shoes
I didn't understand that sentence.

>consult notes about shoes
The shoes, according to these pages, symbolize their wearer's right to tread in and be master of the territory of the dead.

"For which reason I wear them always to funerals and in graveyards", remark the notes conversationally, "the which habit has greatly offended some of the noble ladies through the cause of the shoes not being a suitable color for such occasions." Before you can build up much sympathy, Lucrezia continues: "Therefore in recompense I enslaved two of these ladies to my personal service and gave a third to my son to be his concubine until better manners and humility attend them all."

Some additional function for the shoes is suggested by the papers -- something about the preservation of memory or a connection to those who wore them previously -- but it seems that even Lucrezia did not understand this very well. ("And for this reason I am determined never to let them fall into the hands of another, but to have them burnt on my pyre at the moment of my death, lest those that follow after learn my secrets.") That scheme didn't work out for her, evidently.

>consult notes about lucrezia
Though the notes are of her writing, they are for the most part not about her: she was not a diarist, but an experimenter.

>consult notes about castle
Whenever she writes about her family or her husband, it is with a kind of weary exasperation. You have the sense that none of them were-- or seemed to be-- nearly as intelligent as Lucrezia herself, and she therefore protected and despised them.

About the pen there is a considerable raving: "Many tests of fire, water, pressure, torsion, acid, and poison have failed; even gunpowder and holy water have not sufficed to ruin it; nor do I now believe that it can be destroyed, but suppose that, being plucked from the wing of the old man my father, it partakes of his same eternal nature. Therefore the arrangement must be dissolved in some other way."

>consult notes about contract book
Mostly some speculative notes about the possibility of voiding contracts through some loophole of demonic legalism. You don't entirely follow it. At any rate, to judge by this, she had obtained a kind of mastery over the crypt-spirits by use of her magic shoes. And there is also a reference to a room upstairs, behind the ivory door.

On the wall, as a curio, hangs an open shackle -- sign of the only person ever to have escaped the power of this place.

As you walk out of the room, you notice that your footsteps sound odd.

Central Crypt
A relic-storage place for all the bits of men and women -- and creatures -- bound to the Kings over many centuries. Only brute animals are free of binding, since they have no souls; which is why there are no dogs in the castle, no horses, no songbirds.

Virgin's End
The resting place of maidens who died before marrying those to whom they were engaged.

Apprentice's Workshop
A mausoleum for apprentices who perished before their terms of indenture were complete.

Servant Quarters
Not a room friendly to visitors, it has the air of resentful, martyred suffering. Even His most unpleasant ancestors would not have grudged this place more paint, surely, and more straw for the beds.

Enormous Kitchen
Haunted with the spirits of chefs past, generations and generations of culinary geniuses; one can never predict its whimsies.

>e

Great Dining Hall
Such a long hall that the soup might get cold between one end and the other. You and he used only the far west end, nearest the kitchen. Once you took to dining together at all, that is; the first few months he brought trays to your room, while you hid.

But then you took to eating here; and at the end of every meal he would stand up formally and ask his question.

Law Library
Many books of precedent line these walls, containing every kind of contract that can be made to bind every kind of soul.

A hole in the floor descends to the other, less savory portion of this place.

In the lower chamber, you find, there is almost as much sand as there is above; it must have been flowing a very long time.

Translation Room
Endowed with a deep power that dissolves into ready vernacular even the most ancient and secret scripts of the Law Library.

You can see an ordinary quill pen here.

>consult contract book about elephant
A worked bronze gong, according to this, controls a shape-shifting djinn of considerable size and destructive power, which resents the terms of its enslavement and would be overjoyed to take revenge.

This djinn has taken many forms in the past, but most frequently disguises itself as an elephant.

State Rotunda
Built for the bureaucratic offices of the palace. Inlaid in the floor is the map of all the lands that once this palace commanded; and from the stains and driblets of wax, it is clear to you that someone at some time thought it useful to set a candle at the map's center, and observe the result.

>e

Parliamentary Chambers
Despite its grand name, this is one of the smaller chambers of the castle, because the kings were never inclined to brook too much advice. On each side of the room are two neat oak benches, seating for perhaps thirty men -- and, more rarely, women, and a few characters who could not be called by either term.

>e

Cloister Walk
A pleasant cloister overlooking the rose garden to the north. You have walked it many times, seeking to waste the excesses of time at your disposal.

>e
Walk's End
Lucrezia, they say, died here. It is only a turning point in the corridor, with a bench.

The Beast's thoughts intrude on yours, courtesy of the enchanted shoes: an unexpected burst of sentiment. He loves this place, because he so often spoke with you here, and it is overlaid with odd glimpses of yourself, gestures and expressions you did not know looked so funny.


>nw

Rose Garden
Only one kind of rose grows here, a pink only just distinct from white. This strain creeps over the ground and climbs the walls of the cloister.

In the middle of the garden a way slopes into the ground, reminding you of the entrance to a burial mound.

>d

Rooted Room
Cut as an afterthought through earth and the underside of the garden, and therefore muddy and soil-scented.

Bell Castings
A room of scrap and refuse: wooden structures and clay molds from which bells might be made, scrap metal, pieces of bells now broken.

Zoo
A resting place for an animal: warm but rough. There is little to suggest, from this environment, that he thinks of himself as a man at all, though he is capable of walking upright and eating with utensils, of reading books and even of writing a legible hand.

The only distinguishing mark is a miniature hung on the wall, like a devotional object, or perhaps a reminder. Something about the sole image in an otherwise bare room reminds you of the royal portrait in the Green Bedroom.

The Beast's thoughts intrude on yours, courtesy of the enchanted shoes: largely self-disgust, the image of himself as the kind of creature who belongs here. He really has very good manners. There are whole evenings when you almost forget that he isn't shaped like a man.

Bear Corridor
Less couth and cultivated than any other part of the castle, and you have been forbidden to visit this place before now. The walls press close to you on either side. The floor slopes down. Bears with sharp claws are carved into the rock, but they remind you of Him, and you are not frightened.

Rocky Chamber
A tight, rocky corner among foundations of the oldest part of the castle. A slow leak in the south wall admits a little water, but not enough to be very destructive.

The home of fathers who died before their children were born.

Tokens of binding are stored here: bones and bits of hair, relics, hearts scientifically dried, and many other things, culled through the centuries by the masters of this place, in drawers.

With some effort, you find the contract, which turns to be one of a large number of contracts involving young women. These all occur towards the end of the book, shortly before your own.

In fact, this is the very last contract recorded before your father's and yours: a young woman named Yvette, brought to the castle -- though she was betrothed to a lord already -- to "serve" the king. You have the impression that the contract book is leaving out a good deal, such as why Yvette was associated with the girdle, and what she was doing here.

You sift through the papers until you find a pertinent entry: that the girdle is to be in some way a device for the punishment or forgiveness of those who abuse the castle's power, "being in the possession of the weakest of its victims". Accompanying this are a bundle of astrological diagrams, so who knows how reliable that may be thought to be.

>consult notes about contract book
Mostly some speculative notes about the possibility of voiding contracts through some loophole of demonic legalism. You don't entirely follow it. At any rate, to judge by this, she had obtained a kind of mastery over the crypt-spirits by use of her magic shoes. And there is also a reference to a room upstairs, behind the ivory door.

Empty Bedroom
Like a monk's chamber compared to every other part of the palace, just bare walls now. Here your father stayed, when he made his ill-fated journey to the castle. The Beast told you this, on your first visit.

On the wall, as a curio, hangs an open shackle -- sign of the only person ever to have escaped the power of this place.

The Beast's thoughts intrude on yours, courtesy of the enchanted shoes: I told your father I doubted anyone would willingly trade places with him. In the whole history of my family, I don't know of a single person who has exchanged contracts, until you. Then -- what might be your thought or might be his -- He wasn't worth it, you know.

Private Parlor
A sitting room of the family, in old times, and familiar territory to you now as well. Your bedroom is just south; other bedrooms, mostly smaller, in other directions.

Nearby an open heavy door leads north to the bellroom.

The south end of the room is most dazzling, because of the daylight from the balcony.

The Beast's thoughts intrude on yours, courtesy of the enchanted shoes: affection, longing, guilt; amusement at your innocence and anger at your blindness; frank desire. Such a tangled, terrifying mess of emotion that you barely recognize yourself in the mirrors.

Sorry. The thought is sleepy and not entirely comforting.

You step out into the rain.

Gilded Balcony
A ridiculous filigreed balcony that is like nothing so much as a birdcage: and from here you can see all the way across the moat, across the forest, the plain, to the edge of the sea, only by staring long enough in any direction.

The Beast's thoughts intrude on yours, courtesy of the enchanted shoes: Thought the cage metaphor quite unsubtle; but I thought you might like it anyway, being able to see all that distance. This room is built above the watchtower down below, you see, part of a vertical line of power.

Having more personality than most of the bedrooms, it was decorated for someone specific and has been left that way: green and white, with a simple rustic cast unusual for the palace.

The chief exception is the royal portrait on the wall, hung at a height and in a position that reminds you of the miniature in the Zoo.

Gallery of Historical Paintings
Here on the north wall and the south are paintings of historical events from times past: the assassination of King Elzibad in 1248; the arrival of Princess Lucrezia from the Italian State of Medici-Credenza in 1545.

There is no fire in the big fireplace; the air is very cold. Over the gate, the old familiar warning sign is painted.

A worked bronze gong, according to this, controls a shape-shifting djinn of considerable size and destructive power, which resents the terms of its enslavement and would be overjoyed to take revenge.

This djinn has taken many forms in the past, but most frequently disguises itself as an elephant.

Scrying Room
A place for consulting with the servants, summoning them by their instruments and allowing their spirits to manifest in the mirrors. But you know this only from explanation, because the mirrors and glasses have been broken or carried away to the Crystal Bedroom, when they ceased to reflect anything that gave pleasure to their master.

Nearby an open small door leads west to the treasure room.

The Beast's thoughts intrude on yours, courtesy of the enchanted shoes: Mostly we used all this for communicating with the enslaved, bringing their spirits to the mirrors to speak to us. That was easily done, by ringing the bells. The more difficult stuff, real prophecy, foresight -- only a few of our line ever had those powers. Lucrezia, mostly.

>play gong
You ring the worked bronze gong hopefully, but -- despite the old function of the room -- there are no mirrored surfaces remaining in which your summoned spirit can manifest itself, because you took those all upstairs to your bedroom.

Despite its grand name, this is one of the smaller chambers of the castle, because the kings were never inclined to brook too much advice. On each side of the room are two neat oak benches, seating for perhaps thirty men -- and, more rarely, women, and a few characters who could not be called by either term.

It takes some searching, but you find it eventually. The king in these parts was accustomed to bring young ladies to the castle when his wooing of them was unsuccessful, whereupon they were under contract and unable to resist him.

This he did for many years, snatching away men's brides; until one day he stole Yvette. She was only a humble milkmaid, but so beautiful she was betrothed to a lord, etc., etc., and moreover her great-great-grandmother had been Lucrezia the Enchantress (oh dear), so she possessed a magical girdle of surpassing power.

When she discovered what was about to happen to her, while she was still on the drawbridge of the castle, she cursed the king to become a mere beast, so that the spell would never be lifted until someone loved him who was not under magical contract. What was more, this person would need the power of that same magical girdle...

There is even a small woodcut of the grieving Yvette, carrying a cow bell and looking downtrodden.

From that day on the castle was so built that no one could even enter into it without becoming contracted to its king, for the protection of the royal family.

You quickly skim the unpleasant history of Lucrezia of Medici-Credenza, how she brought odd magical treasures with her, introduced new methods of binding and contracting that were previously unknown even to this castle, and maintained a room for her studies in the basement below the rose garden. From this room everyone including her husband was banned.

There are some suggestions that she was the daughter of the Devil himself, sent to the castle to tempt the kings into further folly and destruction. But who knows?

The thread of thought stops. On second thought, that is not a story I am proud of.

Carvings around the outer edge of the stand indicate how one should use it: a small tonsured figure places a book on the stand, then rings a bell; whereupon a librarian, bearing the traditional shackles and sheets of a ghost, appears to take it away.

When the girl's father married again, the second wife was very cruel and miserly... (etc. at some length); but whenever the girl was lonely, she took the wooden clapper to the mirror in her mother's bedroom and clapped it loudly; and her mother's spirit would appear to her and advise her...

Gallery of Still Life
Natural light from the south -- coming in from the courtyard, you suppose, though you are too short to see out -- illuminates a series of still life paintings on the north wall: one showing the Wedding Treasure when Lucrezia arrived from Medici-Credenza, the other rather fancifully entitled Supper with M.

A place for consulting with the servants, summoning them by their instruments and allowing their spirits to manifest in the mirrors.

Nearby an open small door leads west to the treasure room.

You head up to the debtor's paradise. Then north to the central crypt. Then up to the law library. , emerging into the law library. Then north to the lower bulb. You walk far enough in to get a view of sand falling in a huge hourglass. Though it is only a thin stream, it sounds louder than it should: the noise, magnified by your helmet, becomes too much to bear, and you retreat.

>remove helmet
You lift the helmet from your head, and the sudden quiet feels like going deaf.

>go to lie library
You head north to the lower bulb. Then up to the upper bulb. Then southwest to the smoke-damaged chamber. And finally east to the lie library.

Lie Library
Fables, fictions, and falsehoods, arranged by number by type, and containing such categories as "In which the hero receives help from three aged figures," "In which the villain has a mysterious name," and so on.

You can see a storybook and a book return stand (on which is a great contract book) here.

>put inkpot on stand
You put the infernal inkpot on the book return stand.

>ring glass bell
You summon the librarian, who comes and looks at the contract book: you see this as a sort of fog. It frowns at the condition of some of the pages, then searches the front and back of the book; then, grimacing, it takes out a red seal like those used in the empire of the Chan.

It inks this carefully from the inkpot, then stamps inside the front of the book:


PROPERTY OF THE LIE LIBRARY
DO NOT REMOVE

...whereupon the contracts inside begin to unravel and dissolve into the merest stories.

You never do discover any final rest or cure for the Beast. But perhaps that is a small price to pay for all the souls you have liberated.

>consult papers about girdle
You can't see any such thing.

>consult notes about girdle
You sift through the papers until you find a pertinent entry: that the girdle is to be in some way a device for the punishment or forgiveness of those who abuse the castle's power, "being in the possession of the weakest of its victims". Accompanying this are a bundle of astrological diagrams, so who knows how reliable that may be thought to be.

>go to bedroom
Which do you mean, the Green Bedroom, the Guest Bedroom, the Empty Bedroom, or the Crystal Bedroom?

>crystal
You head west to the smoke-damaged chamber. Then northeast to the upper bulb. Then east to the gallery of still life. Then east to the white gallery. Then east to the bellroom. Then south to the private parlor. And finally south to the crystal bedroom.

Crystal Bedroom
A fantasia of gleaming and glittering, chandeliers and mirrors: all that shines or reflects has been moved here, into this room that you inhabit, which he never enters.

The south end of the room is most dazzling, because of the daylight from the balcony.

>ring cow bell
You ring the cow bell, and a heavy fog coalesces around you; then at the mirror there forms the image of an exceptionally beautiful young woman, wearing a green girdle.

"It is a long time since I was called," she says, pressing her nose and fingers to her side of the glass and looking at you with interest. You see around her neck the burn of a noose, and guess uneasily at what she did to herself. She looks at you with plain curiosity.

"So you're the one?" she asks. "Did you know that he carried me over the drawbridge into the castle, and made me slave to his wishes even though I was betrothed to another? and that for the breach of contract my father died impoverished?"

You say nothing. You have not known him to be like that; but many human lifetimes have passed since Yvette was alive.

She shrugs one shoulder. "If you can love such a creature, then I will leave the green girdle for you on my grave; you come take it and kiss him," she says.

Then she fades from view.

>ring glass bell
Many faces press to the far side of the mirror, but no one shade has the strength to speak, and finally they fade away again, half-damned.

>ring gong
Many faces press to the far side of the mirror, but no one shade has the strength to speak, and finally they fade away again, half-damned.

>go to crypt
You head north to the private parlor. Then west to the upstairs helical staircase. Then down to the ground floor helical staircase. Then west to the central courtyard. Then north to the state rotunda. Then southwest to the law library. And finally down to the central crypt.

Central Crypt
A relic-storage place for all the bits of men and women -- and creatures -- bound to the Kings over many centuries. Only brute animals are free of binding, since they have no souls; which is why there are no dogs in the castle, no horses, no songbirds.

>n

Virgin's End
The resting place of maidens who died before marrying those to whom they were engaged.

You can see a magic girdle here.

>get girdle
You acquire the magic girdle, and assess it curiously.

It is the green girdle familiar to you from paintings here; a possession of Lucrezia's.

>wear girdle
You put on the girdle, securing it around you. It fits unexpectedly well.

>go to beast
You head south to the central crypt. Then up to the law library. , emerging into the law library. Then north to the lower bulb. , emerging into the lower bulb. And then up to the upper bulb.

Upper Bulb
In the upper chamber, you find, there is almost as much sand as there is below; indeed for all you can tell the flow might be eternal.

Nearby an open ivory door leads southwest to the smoke-damaged chamber.

And here Beast lies, sprawled on the ground as if he'd fallen.

When you look at the Beast this time -- it must be the influence of the girdle -- you see him as more animal than human, though you long ago learned to discern a man's expressions on his face.

I was afraid of him, says the memory of Yvette in your head, as though she's trying to justify herself to you. There are other thoughts as well, murkier; but you are left with the impression that she killed herself, in the end, not because of her family's misfortunes or the lord she was separated from; but because she was carrying a child, and feared that it would be born some kind of monster.

>kiss beast
As you do, you can't help remembering -- because of the girdle -- how many women before you this king imprisoned against their will. And why should he deserve to be forgiven, merely because he has been less cruel to you than to the others?

When you lift your head, he is his proper self: a man, about forty-five. Handsome, perhaps, but in the style of the lord mayor, not someone you would have aspired to wed. His face has perhaps softened a little since his youth, but he is still recognizably the same person.

He looks ruefully at his restored hands. "I failed to free them," he says. "And now I've dragged you into the trouble with me."

You shake your head, and try to calm him.

His fingers stretch in experiment. "Dear virgin mother. You did it. The servants are free?"

You nod.

"Good girl." He touches your cheek affectionately; then freezes. "And you're wearing Yvette's girdle. I suppose you heard her story, in that case." He sticks out his jaw. "You can go now. It won't kill me, this time."

You draw a breath and give him your answer.

This is a keyboardless text adventure game. You are taking part in an interactive story – I will tell you what is going on in this pane. In the panes on the right (or below this one, for portrait screens), I’ll tell you where I am, what I can see, and what I’m carrying. To give me an instruction, click or touch one of the buttons there – either a direction telling me where to go, or an action applying to something I can see. Click an item in the “I’m carrying” list to hold that item, which may make more actions available. Have fun, and happy adventuring!

“What can I do for you?” I ask the guy.
“Mr Rose,” he squeaks, “my name is Wexler. My employer would very much like to speak with you. There’s a somethin’ needs lookin’ into, see, and let’s say they don’t want to go through the official channels on this one.”

> ask wexler about employer
“Your employer?” I ask.
“These guys,” says Wexler, and gives me a handbill.

It’s a handbill for a funeral directors on Louisiana and 3rd. The blurb reads:
“We know that losing a loved one can
have difficult consequences and be
hard to deal with. It can get our
spirits down. That’s why all of us
at Marlotte & Jenkins will do
our very best for you. Come in and
speak to us and we’ll make it
easy.”
“Your employer is a funeral director?” I ask Wexler. “What’s so hush-hush about that?”
Wexler’s mouth twitches. “Just read the first word on every line,” he says.

> ask wexler about money
“Now,” I say. “About my rates…”
“Fifty now, and fifty when you finish the job,” he says.
It’s acceptable, so I accept.

“Oh, all those?” says Gianni. “Ha, yeah, I guess business is good today! Come on, Luigi, we got stiffs to shift.”

“Oh dear,” he adds. “Some people just got no respect for other people’s property. What do you think of that, Luigi?”
Luigi, being a man of few words, prefers to express his opinion by socking me in the face.
Everything goes black.

“Too bad we didn’t find it, Luigi,” says the voice of Gianni. “We’ll just tell the Donna you got thirsty, I guess.”
I feel the coffin being lifted and carried… down a flight of stairs… and lowered to the floor.
A lady bartender lifts the lid and I climb out. Suddenly, a lot of eyes are on me.
“Do you mind telling me what you were doing in my supply of illicit b–” begins the bartender. “I mean – wow, this one’s still alive! Everybody, cancel the funeral, we’ve had a miracle!”
“Relax,” I say. “I ain’t a flatfoot. My name is Lanson Rose, and I was led to believe that someone here might want to speak with me.”
“Let me guess,” says the bartender with a frown. “Little guy talk to you, looks like a rat? Fine, since you’re here, let’s see if you’re any use. We’ll talk in my office. Boys, that’ll be all for now.”
Gianni and Luigi pick up the empty coffin and leave. The bartender walks into the back office, beckoning me to follow.

“It can’t be that bad,” I said. “At least, not worse than most of what you can find these days.”
“Well, she says, “it wasn’t bad last month. In fact I prided myself on servin’ the best drop a hooch in New Losago. I wanna know what’s goin’ on, and I want my good booze back.”

“Who supplies you with the booze?” I ask her.
“Those two goons, Gianni and Luigi, bring it over,” says Vivienne. “I think they work for some rich dame over in Princeley Heights.”

> ask vivienne about hearse
“So,” I ask her, “whose idea was the hearse?”
“That came with the business,” she says. “It seemed like a good way to smuggle the booze in, so I gave the boys the keys. Hold on, I got a spare set somewhere…”
She opens a drawer and rifles through the desk for a moment.
“Here they are,” she says, and hands me a set of car keys.

> ask vivienne about business
“And how’s a dame like you get into the speakeasy business?” I ask.
“Daddy was a funeral director. A real one. I inherited the business the day Prohibition got signed into law, and I didn’t want a career luggin’ stiffs around.”

“They call me ‘Snake Fingers’ Jackson,” he says. “How’s things?”

“What do you know about this place?” I ask.
“I been comin’ here a while,” he says, taking a sip of his drink and making a sour face. “Drinks sure used to be better.”

> ask snake fingers about booze
“It’s very… interesting liquor they serve here,” I say. “Any idea where it comes from?”
“Sure,” he says. “Rich white family over in Princeley Heights. Got the bootlegging business sewn up in this town. Hired me to play at some big wedding on their lawn last year. Here, I’ll give you the address.”
He pulls out a scrap of paper, scribbles an address on it, and gives it to me.

It reads:
“1306 Princeley Blvd (at Nebraska St)”

“That’s some noise you make with that thing,” I tell him, with a nod to the horn in his right hand.

My heart just about stops. That lady? I seen her mugshots pulled out in relation to a dozen murder cases, but there’s never been enough evidence to put her away. That’s Donna Cardicci. And if this is her house, and I’m caught tresspassing in it, I’m a dead man.
The boys are familiar too. A skinny one and a big one. They’re a little younger, but sure enough, that’s those two goons from the funeral directors, Gianni and Luigi.

> ask mary jo lou belle about moonshine
I lower my voice and lean in. “Now if I were to inform Mr Epsom about your previous occupation, do you think you’d keep this job?”
Mary Lou Jo Belle snorts. “Go ahead. Mr Epsom likes a drink as much as anyone else.”

> talk to lawyer
“I am J Epsom, Esquire,” says the lawyer. “How do you do?”
“Lanson Rose, private investigator,” I say.

> tell mr epsom about moonshine
“Would it interest you to know,” I say, “that your secretary over there previously worked as a moonshine maker in some swamp in the mountains?”
“Come now, Mr Rose,” says Mr Epsom with a thin smile. “You and I know Prohibition is a sham. Everyone carries on drinking, everyone is well aware of it, but the police can now arrest whomever they choose. Which of course does not include pillars of the status quo like ourselves. Miss Clunkett is an excellent secretary and I am willing to overlook her employment history.”

> ask mr epsom about mary jo lou belle
“Where did you find your secretary?” I ask him.
“She walked in and asked for a job. I’m a generous man, she shows excellent organisational skills, and she didn’t seem to have a clue what an acceptable salary was. Did you, dear?” he adds, with a patronising smile in Mary Jo Lou Belle’s direction.

> ask mr epsom about firm

“Oh, you know,” he says. “As long as people don’t all start getting along, there’ll always be plenty of work for us.”

I wait until nobody’s looking and quickly flick through the papers in the inbox. Something catches my eye: a condemnation order for a tiny hamlet southeast of the city called Swampy Hollow. I pull it out.

> read condemnation order
This is an order for the compulsory sale to the state of some land southeast of New Losago known as “Swampy Hollow”, and the demolition of all structures built on it. The sale price don’t look exactly fair, either. It’s signed by the state governor and witnessed by a Senator Brinkman.

> show condemnation order
(to Mary Jo Lou Belle)
“Take a look at this,” I say to the girl. “Swampy Hollow. Ain’t that where your folks hail from?”
Mary Jo Lou Belle takes the paper, reads it, then angrily waves it at Mr Epsom.
“What’s this?” she demands. “You’re helpin’ someone demolish my home swamp?”
“Oh, is that where you’re from?” says Mr Epsom. “Well, you’ve moved on from there, haven’t you? You can live in a proper apartment in the city, eat real food instead of roadkill…”
“That’s it!” she says. “I quit!”
She throws the paper to the floor and storms out of the office.

“I guess you’re right,” she says simply.
Her gaze meets mine for a moment, then she walks away.

Case closed: SPEAKEASY STREET
Some people just got callings, whether they like ’em or not. Detectives gotta detect, and moonshiners gotta moonshine. The good booze will be flowing again shortly, and a city with good booze is a city with good times. And who knows, maybe soon someone will put up enough bribe money to get Prohibition repealed, and the girl can follow her heart then.

“Maybe not that,” says the girl. “But I got places I wanna see. Plus,” she adds with a smile, “I stole fifty grand off that creep.” She pats her handbag, looks at me for a moment, and walks out of my life.

“Can you tell me any more regarding your husband’s work at Corndale?” I say to her.
“He’s worked there for twenty years, since long before I met him,” she tells me. “For the last three years, he’s been working on a top secret project. He never told me anything about it. Just kept saying he was on to something big.”

“Forgive me, but I took a peep at your drawers,” I tell her. “Been taking an interest in the Professor’s work, have you?”
She glares. “I guess you may as well know – he’s no scientist. Barely knows the difference between a monoglyceride and a phospholipid. The college board gave him the job as a courtesy because his old man funded the place. He gets a lab to sit in and do crossword puzzles. I can tell you’ve been wondering why I married him – that’s why. Those antiques would never employ a woman scientist, so I get to do my research and publish it under his name. What difference does it make, anyway?”
“I don’t know,” I say. “Not much of a chemist myself. What are you working on, anyway?”
“Never you mind,” she snaps. “It’s not relevant.”

> ask mrs macdonald about sandwich
“Let’s try again,” I say. “What is this weird sandwich?”
“All right,” she says coolly. “It’s called a hamburger. A revolutionary advancement in culinary technology! One cow can be ground up into eight thousand of these. They can be cooked in forty-five seconds, and eaten in less.” Her eyes flash. “We are about to enter a new era, Mr Rose – the era of fast food! Stuffy restaurant meals will be a thing of the past! No more lounging around making idle chat with your friends while you wait for your supper. No more obsequious waiters, no more pretentious menus! Just get in, eat your damn hamburger and get out!”
“I see,” I say. “And was everybody as thrilled about this ‘fast food’ revolution as you?”
“Well, no,” she says. “Gilbert got some hate mail. Chefs, restaurateurs, food snobs. Jealous.” She stops. “You don’t think that might have something to do with his disappearance?”

> ask mrs macdonald about hate mail
“This hate mail,” I say. “You coulda mentioned it earlier. I’d be interested to read it.”
“He said he just left it in his pigeonhole at work,” she replies. “Here, I’ll give you a key.” She rummages in her décolletage, pulls out a small mailbox key, and hands it to me.

“Any of you boys know a Professor Macdonald who works here?” I ask.
“I take his food science class, but he hasn’t been in this week,” says a senior with a check jacket. “Arrogant old guy. Kept telling us we may as well not bother taking notes, because his research was about to make the whole subject obsolete anyway.”

> ask students about college
“How are you finding it here at Corndale?” I ask.
“Swell, I guess,” says a graduate student. “Only…” he looks sheepish. “There are no girls.”
I look along the line of clean young male faces. He’s right. This ain’t one of those progressive colleges.

“Gee whiz,” says a sophomore with a check jacket. “That bird’s sitting on a flagpole. He’s invented a new craze!”
A well-dressed graduate student with a bow tie runs out to the phone booth on the street and dials. “Hey Shipwreck, it’s your cousin, Marvin Kelly,” he says. “You know that new pointless fad you’re looking for? Well, listen to this…”
“Let’s ALL find flagpoles to sit on,” puts in a sophomore.

“Sorry about the wait, si-” he begins, then trips over the spaghetti. As he flails to catch his balance, he pivots around, then falls to the floor on his back.
The pizza in his hands goes flying, arcs, and falls slice by slice into his gaping mouth.
He sputters and turns slightly pink, but manages to gulp it down. Furiously, he gets to his feet, pulls out a rolling pin and clonks me on the head.
“Now,” I hear his voice say, “I put Signore Professor back in the closet, and you forget, yes?”
Everything goes black.

I wake up a couple hours later in a hospital ward with a sore head.

A girl clatters past on an expensive bicycle.
A yellow cab comes into view.

>look
You wrench your eyes open. Rough grey stone. Grey stone ceiling. Your head hurts, and --
You're lying on the floor. You're staring at the ceiling, and it's rough and grey, and you don't
recognize it.
You roll slowly (smooth cold floor?) and try to sit up. It hurts. You crawl upright. The walls, rough
stone also, scrape your aching fingers. You can't -- there was white agony, felt like raw light
tearing you apart. You can't remember anything after that.
You can't remember anything before that. Gone. You clutch at memory, and there's nothing but
empty air.
Cell
This space, barely wider than outstretched arms, seems to have been chopped raw and square
from unfinished stone. Only the floor is smooth -- a fine white surface beneath your feet. There
is a narrow gap in the east wall.
[Don't know how to get started? Type "help" and then hit enter.]
>help
This tutorial has lots of built-in help on how to play text adventures. To read more, type "help"
followed by whatever it is you want to get help on, and then hit enter. For example, you can type
"help basics" to see the most important IF commands.
>help basics
These are the commands you will use most often.
"look" or "l": Look around the room -- repeat the description of everything you see.
"examine thing" or "x thing": Look more closely at something -- learn more about it.
"inventory" or "i": List everything you're carrying.
"north", "south", "east", "west", etc., or "n", "s", "e", "w", etc.: Walk in some direction.
For more about these commands -- or any command used in this game -- type "help" followed
by the command word. For example, "help look". You might want to start by looking at the help
information for all of these basic commands.
For even more help topics and commands, just type "help".
>look
Cell
This space, barely wider than outstretched arms, seems to have been chopped raw and square
from unfinished stone. Only the floor is smooth -- a fine white surface beneath your feet. There
is a narrow gap in the east wall.
>examine floor
The floor is also stone, but fine-grained and smooth -- not quite polished. It is very white; white
enough to show faint smudges where you lay.
>touch floor
Papery smooth, but cold and hard.
>walk east
You duck your head and push through the gap.
Narrow Hallway
You are standing in a short windowless hallway. To the east is the foot of a flight of stairs, which
rises out of sight. To the west, the hallway narrows, ending in a small gap of a doorway.
[Looks like you've taken the first step. Well done.
Let me introduce myself. I am the Voice of this tutorial. Most games don't have me; but in this
game, I will watch over your shoulder and give you some help. With a little practice, you'll soon
be moving around the text adventure world in style.
Back to the story. Remember what's going on? Actually, you don't. As the introduction said, you
can't remember who you are or what you're doing here!
Amnesia. Yes, it's a cliché, but it'll do for a tutorial.
I'll let you go on exploring. The west corridor leads back to the cell where you started, so you'll
want to try up the stairs instead. Type "up" or "climb stairs".]
>up
You begin climbing the stairs. They seem to go on for a long while... pressing between dim
stone walls (where is the light coming from? You haven't seen a window yet)... climbing... (how
far?)...
Until you pass through a doorway into warm candlelight.
Crowded Study
You stand amid clutter, oddments, shelves and stacks. The chamber is comfortably broad,
centered around a massive and well-worn wooden desk. But so much is jammed in, around the
desk and up the panelled walls, that you barely find room to stand. Books; papers; dried plants;
animals stuffed and preserved, antique instruments, candles of any hue. You don't recognize
half of it, and you can't name half the rest.
There are wide doorways on the north and east sides of the room. A door of heavy wood stands
closed to the south, and stairs descend into dimness to the west.
You see an immense book on the desk. Behind the desk is a tall glass-fronted cabinet. Beside
that is a small brass trunk, which is closed.
If there were a quarter as much here, and a tenth as many books, you might be in any scholar's
study. But this knowledge must represent lifetimes of work -- lifetimes under a single hand. You
do not know where you are, but you know what this place is: a dreamhold. A wizard's high
house.
You do not find yourself afraid. A dreamhold is more than merely dangerous.
>examine clutter
You look helplessly about. You couldn't catalogue it all in a wizard's years.
Something in the chaos catches your eye. It looks like a white papier-mache mask, lying beside
the desk.
>take mask
Taken.
[Your score has gone up.
Your score is displayed in the top right corner of the window. "1 of 7" means you've achieved
one out of seven main goals. The score increased when you picked up the white mask; so
presumably there are seven masks to find in the game.
You can get a full account of your score by typing "score".]
>examine oddments
You look helplessly about. You couldn't catalogue it all in a wizard's years.
>examine shelves
Books are lined up on shelves, stacked on the floor, scattered in hazard across everything else
in the room. You glance at a few titles, gingerly lift a cover -- but you recognize none of the
many scripts and languages you find.
>take book
The immense book does not seem to want to move from its place on the desk.
>examine desk
The desk is heavy and plain, a massive wooden construction. Surprisingly, the surface is bare,
except for an immense book.
>touch desk
You feel nothing unexpected.
>touch book
You feel nothing unexpected.
>examine book
The book lies open. You frown at the fine, angular hand -- the same as enscribes every other
book in the room -- but discover that you can read it:
 The Theory & UNDERSTANDING of Portalls;
The lesser, which make a single place of many, and the Greater, which open from NOW into
Time in Memory, or Prophecy Foretold, or even a Moment's Fancy;
All portals are perilous. Perilous thresholds to cross, and more perilous to create; For there is no
plying of the World, or of Time, that does not happen in the Mind of the learned one who
conceives of the journey. Of your Thought is the portal built, arch and capstone. Slip but a
moment of your attention, and the Portal will fall into ruin; All its might, and yours, crumbled into
eggshell fragments that stray upon the Wind; ...
The facing page shows an elaborate circular diagram, annotated here and there with tiny
mathematical notes. The only comment you understand, tucked in a margin, says "Best to draw
in a well-insulated space -- 35 Ll. of uncut stone? -- move house to Emmen Valley, work into
mountain?"
>draw portal
You cannot envision that clearly enough to draw it.
>wear mask
The mask has no ribbons to tie -- it is not even curved to fit a human face. In any case, it's half
life-size. It cannot be worn.
Nonetheless, you try raising the mask before your eyes....
...Memory stirs...
A child runs through the forest. A robe, richly bright-embroidered, has slipped off one skinny
shoulder -- a child old enough to be put in clothes, too young to know what it means to wear
them. A silver-haired child whose glance darts from tree to bird, caught everywhere.
A mother's voice shouting. Not patient, not yet urgent. The child attends this, with the same
interest as bush, flower, fascinating new rustle underfoot...
The name, again.
A moist leaf, torn from a tree, clutched in a small fist. Tossed in the air. Blown about, blown
upwards again and again, as the child dances back and forth, face raised, flushed, puffing
madly...
Mother's voice interrupting the game. The child spins once more, dashes back towards dinner.
The leaf flutters about in the air. It circles a tree; then rises to a high branch, clings there. It
seems to bend this way and that; then it casts loose, and flutters determinedly after its
thoughtless maker.
You yank the mask away with a shudder. What are these memories? Do they belong to the
wizard whose house you are disturbing?

stiffly new. But every one seems to be written by the same hand.

Sprays of dried leaves, flowers, and seed pods poke out of various pots. Decoration, medicine,
research? You have no way to tell.

A small square trunk is pushed up against the back wall, beside a tall cabinet. The trunk's
panels and lid are tarnished brass; they're engraved with worn geometric designs. The trunk sits
closed.
>open
What do you want to open?
>open trunk
You hesitate a moment. Prying into a wizard's possessions? But you're already standing in his
home; and you could as easily be damned for making free with his candlelight as with his trunk.
You reach out, flip up the brass lid, and step back in one movement... A copper key glints at the
very bottom of the trunk.
>take key
Taken.
>examine cabinet
The cabinet is a tall and ornate affair; its feet and edges are carved into flamboyant spirals. Two
broad and utterly flawless glass panes form the cabinet's front surface.
The cabinet's shelves are filled with curiosities. Tiny crystals and worn river stones, intricate
knots of wire and slabs of rough metal, scraps of folded paper and loops of colored string. A
small bell of rune-scratched glass. Three beans in a golden dish. A human hand, eye, and
heart, all seemingly carved of chalk. An amethyst scale, the length of your finger, which lies in a
pool of its own light.
>feel edges

The glass panes won't open. The cabinet seems to be locked, although you see no keyhole.

>help
This tutorial has lots of built-in help on how to play text adventures. To read more, type "help"
followed by whatever it is you want to get help on, and then hit enter.
Topics you can get help on:
"help basics": The most important IF commands
"help commands": Some more common commands
"help talking": Commands for talking to other characters
"help system": Saving and loading games, quitting, and other system commands
"help special": Useful odds and ends (which may work differently in different games)
"help strategy": Figuring out what to do, when you're stuck
All of these topics are general information on playing IF. If you are stuck on a particular puzzle
in THE DREAMHOLD, type "help hint" for a single hint on what to try next.
>help strategy
Every text adventure is different. But here are some simple ideas which will help you in nearly
any game.
* Examine everything. (Type "help examine" for more on this command.) Even if there are many
things in the room, try to examine each one, at least once. Be systematic.
* Notice which objects the game is focussing your attention on, and which seem to be
background or scenery. (If it looks like the most important thing in the room, it probably is. If the
game says it's not important, it probably isn't.)
* Try to interact with things. Use common sense. If you see a button, push it. If you find a flute,
play it. And "take" anything that you can possibly lift.
* If you try a command on an object, and you get a distinctive response, your ears should perk
up. It means you're on the right track. Maybe you have to try a related command, or change
something else in the environment, or bring a second object in somehow. Maybe you won't be
able to complete the action until later in the game. But it's important.
* Notice when the game is leading you towards a specific command. If the game says "You
could probably bend the bars," then "bend bars" is worth trying.
* Pay attention to common elements. If you find rubies and emeralds, look for red and green
places to sell, put, or drop them. If a machine is made of brass, look for a brass part to add to it.
If a door is barred by shimmering silver light, look for anything that magically glows with a similar
light.
* When you find something which moves by itself, hang out and watch it for a while. You may
need to understand its entire range of movement.
And remember, the game world is a world. It has its own logic -- whimsy or dream logic perhaps,
but still sense. Find the game's time and reason, and follow it. You will find a way through.
>help commands
These are the most common ways of interacting with the game's world. It's usually worth trying
these, in almost any situation. You never know what might happen -- or what you might learn.
These commands do what they say. Common sense applies. There are many more possibilities
-- every game has its own variations, depending on what actions make sense in a particular
situation. For more information, type "help" followed by any command word.
"get thing", "drop thing"

Curtained Room
The walls of this small room are entirely swathed in heavy brocade curtains. The only openings
are to the west and northwest, and a closed lead-slab door to the south.
In the center of the room is a massive, high-backed chair of some pale wood. Directly before it is
a tall mirror in a standing frame.
>examine curtains
Curtains of dark silk brocade fall from ceiling to floor, all around you. The rough folds seem to
soak up sound; the silence drags at you.
>move curtains
The curtains are fixed overhead. They don't open or close.
>sit in chair
You sit down in the chair, facing the mirror.
>examine chair
The chair is cut from heavy planks of pale wood. It has a solid base, high arms and back --
nearly a throne, you think. The joinery is rough, but the surface has been finished to a smooth
fineness. The chair is positioned in front of a standing mirror.
>examine mirror
You blink and stare into the mirror. How odd.
The mirror reflects your chair, and the curtains behind you, perfectly. But your own form is
unclear -- as if the mirror were touched with some distorting oil. The blurring is strongest around
your upper body; your head appears to be a faceless blank.
Nervously, you raise your hand to your own face. Everything feels in its place. But your
reflection has raised a blurred hand to a featureless void.
And a dim white shadow seems to flit around your reflected body. Then it is gone.

Once again you hold the mask up before your face....

If you doubted this was a dreamhold, you're certain now... the fireplace holds no wood, no ash.
An odd basket of coiled silver wire holds a heap of glassy, glowing, cherry-red spheres.
Insubstantial flames flicker above the spheres, and a mild warmth touches your face and body.
But the spheres do not truly burn; they are not consumed.

Ow! Despite the mildness of the spheres' warmth, their surface holds some humming, stinging

(You can type just part of the name. A single word will usually suffice, if it picks out exactly one
option.)
You could also change your mind and type an entirely new command.]

Mosaic Room
The walls and ceiling of this room are entirely covered with tiny blue tiles. On the east wall, a
few black and grey tiles seem to depict birds on the horizon of a mosaic sky. The only exit is an
archway to the west.
A delicate cage of brass wire hangs from a curved stand in the center of the room. Within the
cage is a single ripe apple.
>examine cage
You've seen -- you might have seen -- such cages in the market, holding songbirds in their
shining wire embrace. This one, however, contains a ripe and perfect apple. You cannot
imagine why. The cage door is closed.
>open cage
You pull open the wire door. Then you jerk back; something invisible seems to burst from the
cage. It rolls across the room like lightning or dessicated time. It echoes.
The apple spots, rots, and sinks into itself in a single instant. Within a heartbeat, the fruit is a
withered husk -- as if it had sat in that cage for decades.
[You may have made a mistake. You're not likely to get that apple back. (One never knows, of
course, but that decay looked very final.) What can you do about it?
One option is to type "undo". This will let you "back up" one move -- back to just before you
opened the cage. Everything will be the same, except that the cage will still be closed and the
apple will still be fresh.
In this game, you can only "undo" one move in a row. So if you do something else now (even
"look" or "examine apple"), you won't be able to jump back to before the cage opened. The
"undo" command is intended only to fix immediate mistakes.
If you want to go back more than one turn, you'll have to use the "restart" or "restore"
commands. Type "help saving" for more information.
(Actually, many games protect you from severe mistakes. Since this is an introductory game,
you don't really have to worry about accidentally running into a dead end. If you truly need a
fresh apple, you'll probably find another way to get one.)]

Atelier
This cramped, boxy room appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floor are
splattered with paints of many colors. Strangely, the room is nearly empty; you see no stacks of
canvas or bottles of pigment. The exit is southwest.
A rough wooden easel is set up at one end of the room. Displayed upon it is a painting -- a
bright mountain landscape.
At the other end of the room, a tripod props up what looks like a small telescope.
A pigment-daubed board, no doubt the artist's palette, is sitting in a corner.
>examine painting
The painting shows a tiny rock pool amid jagged mountain peaks. The landscape is harsh and
unforgiving, but the pool seems a respite. It is rimmed with bright moss, and a few fish-like
shadows are visible in its depths.

...Memory stirs...
In a darkened library, someone works alone. The tall shelves are crowded, but the rows of titles
fade into shadows; only the desk is illuminated. A map is spread upon it. The pen, moving
across its face, annotates and speculates.
Nearly half the map is tinted red. Along the border, marks and notations cluster like wasps.
The silver head snaps up, as an officer enters. He holds a pale cylinder, the length of a tall
man's finger. He places it on the desk; he bows; he turns and leaves. At no point do his eyes
rise from the floor.
The cylinder, unrolled, proves to be a length of parchment: filthy, closely lettered. The tall figure
reads it, once. Then the pen, taken up once again.
In the blank heart of the red-tinted region, quick strokes now emblazon the shape of a crutch.

You see doorways to the south and in the southeast corner of the room. A white-painted door to

Atelier
This cramped, boxy room appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floor are
splattered with paints of many colors. Strangely, the room is nearly empty; you see no stacks of
canvas or bottles of pigment. The exit is southwest.
A rough wooden easel is set up at one end of the room. Displayed upon it is a painting -- a
bright mountain landscape.
At the other end of the room, a tripod props up what looks like a small telescope.

A stark desert is spread in every direction. The harsh grit beneath your feet is littered with dusty

A crumpled white wad is lying here, half-buried in the sand.

You are carrying a knotted string, a desert landscape painting, a stone, a crumpled white letter,
a mountain landscape painting, a copper key, a quill pen, and two masks (a brown mask and a

[You're carrying quite a lot of stuff. You might be wondering how you can juggle it all. Some
games limit the number of things you can carry, or provide you with some kind of sack to carry
your loot around in.
However, many games -- including this one -- simply ignore the problem. Packing your luggage,
or stowing it in some central location, isn't all that much fun. Therefore, the game lets you carry
around as much as you want.]

You are holding a quill pen -- a sturdy black feather, its tip carefully cut to a nib. You have no

You draw the string out in your hands. It's less than a foot of crude, hairy twine, and it's wracked

you laboriously spell out the word PORTRAIT, knotted over and over down the string.

You must be looking out of a sheer cliff, for you can see no ground below the windowsill. Far
below, stone slopes break and crumble into a verdant valley. Sunlight glints off water -- threads
of stream amid the greenery. Beyond the valley, the mountains rise again, and mountains
beyond that.
You stand for a moment, wondering at the view. "If I were a wizard," you think, "I would build a
house overlooking..." But the thought frays, wanders, and is lost.

Dim Shed
This room looks like nothing so much as a small, windowless garden shed. The floor is bare dirt;
the walls are unfinished planks. The only light falls in through the archway to the west. A narrow

A single glove is lying in the corner, lost and alone.

Mountain Path
You stand at the foot of a low rocky cliff. It squats above you, but it obscures little of the vast
blue sky that stretches all around. Mossy boulders hem you in on either side; a tidy path winds
to the south between them. To the north the path enters a crack in the cliff, meeting stairs which
vanish down into enclosed darkness.

Mountain Garden
A tiny pleasance-garden is nestled here, high on a mountainside. Odd bits of statuary stand
among the sculpted slopes and hillocks; small marble pillars mark the borders of the knotted
paths. The lawn is perfectly trimmed. The mountain towers above you to the north; high on its
face you see a featureless white dome. Above that, the sun shines in a wide blue mountain's
sky.
A tidy path runs north between mossy boulders. A wider path curves west, down a grassy slope,
and up to the east. To the south, a few marble steps lead to a balcony, which looks out over a
verdant valley. You can see a particularly tall statue on the balcony.
>examine statues
The garden is marked with marble. The corners and intersections of the spiralled paths are
picked out by small pillars; statues stand here and there, on hillocks and stretches of turf. The
style of carving is strange to you.
Cool mountain air brushes your face.
>x dome
To the north, high on the mountain above you -- not far below the highest peak -- a featureless
dome seems to survey the landscape. The surface is matte white and unreadable; but you can
see a catwalk running around the dome's outer edge.
>s
You step up to the balustrade and look out, to the south...
Marble Balcony
Below this gently curved balcony, the world drops away into a green vista. The stony slopes of
the mountainside beneath you crumble, invaded by bracken and tree, until the mountain pines
merge into verdant forest and a lush valley floor. A bright thread marks a stream; a distant valley
lake is a silver arc. Beyond the valley, and around it, taller mountains stand like patient shadows
in the blue air.
In the center of the balcony, looking out -- as you are -- over the valley, a white marble statue
towers over you. Incongruously, you can see a small gold mask balanced on the statue's face.
>x gold mask
The gold mask rests on the statue's brow, high above you. It looks like a paper cutout of a
human face, half life size. Balanced on the immense statue, it looks rather silly.

...Memory stirs...
A man and a woman; they lean on each other, a dim and distant exhaustion. Between them,
they cradle a dark-haired infant. It is the only thing in the world, as they always are.
A silver head shakes; a hand draws back the blanket. The infant has a clubbed foot -- twisted
and drawn in.
The couple put out their hands, once again. Light curls out of the air. Blue and green, violet and
no color at all, luminous currents slide down the infant's limbs. It twists and whines, fretting, but
the child is exhausted as well.
Then the light splinters and is gone. The foot is unchanged. The infant gathers itself for another
howl. Its parents rock it absently, but they are looking at each other. The silver-haired one snaps
a word -- both know the anger is self-directed, and is despair.

The statue now measures its length on the balcony. It seems to be undamaged -- but the pose it
held while standing serves it ill now. It's balanced awkwardly on knee, elbow, and forehead.

Warm Bower
This corner of the garden is cozily tucked into a natural alcove, surrounded by stone bluffs on
three sides. The sun is hot on your face. To the south, the ground drops away, revealing a lush
valley far below. The path back to the garden curves up around an outcropping to the east.
Small shrubs dot this garden bower, but a single tall and wild bush dominates the space. Its
branches twist in intricate profusion, then leap chaotically upward, spraying gold-veined leaves
through the air.
>s
Low shrubs keep you away from the cliff's edge. Probably this is for the best.
You catch a whiff of woodsmoke -- the same smoke you saw while descending the path. You
glance around for the fire...
...And realize that the smoke is drifting from the bush. You see no flames, nor even ember-glow;
but grey wisps curl from the coal-black stems and branches. The smoke trails up from the bush,
buoyed on its own heat, and vanishes upward in a wind-tossed ribbon.

In the center of the bower, a single dense bush squats, sullen and dark. Its branches knot

chill fog seems to spread out from under the bush; it rolls across the ground and spills from the
edges of the promontory.

smaller than your mind; you cannot inhabit it without growing small and comfortable within it.
Build it -- destroy it -- rewrite it from lifetime to lifetime. Some masters of magic," the voice adds
in afterthought, "come to prefer the gardening."

and up to the east. To the south, a few marble steps lead to a balcony, which looks out over a
verdant valley.

Mountain Path
You stand at the foot of a low rocky cliff. It squats above you, but it obscures little of the vast
blue sky that stretches all around. Mossy boulders hem you in on either side; a tidy path winds
to the south between them. To the north the path enters a crack in the cliff, meeting stairs which
vanish down into enclosed darkness.
>n
You enter the narrow stairway and begin to descend. After only a few steps, you find yourself at
the bottom. Odd....
Dim Shed
This room looks like nothing so much as a small, windowless garden shed. The floor is bare dirt;
the walls are unfinished planks. The only light falls in through the archway to the west. A narrow
opening to the south leads to a steep stairway, which climbs away into darkness.
"To stand in a dreamhold is to be no more than a thought in a wizard's dream." Or so it is said...
somewhere. Certainly this stairway is changeable as a dream.

Curving Hall, South End
The curving corridor ends here. The blank plaster wall to the south features a large window;
sunlight pours in, brightening this end of the hall. You can go through the archway to the east,
take the stairs which ascend to the west, or return north along the corridor.

Dark Dome, East
You stand at the east edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the west, arching into an

pulled open.

Orrery
You stand in a wide, tall, and dimly lit chamber. It has six sides; smaller alcoves open to the
north and south.
The chamber is dominated by a vast machine: an engine of gears, shafts, and clattering motion.
It is primarily a great stately disk of brass which turns on a tilted axis. Smaller wheels pirouette
on the disk's face, bearing globes of delicate glass in their complicated courses.
The great brass disk continues its revolution. The silver wheel is borne out of reach.
You notice a blue mask fluttering from one of the glass globes on the machine's wheels.
>x blue mask
The blue mask looks like a blue paper cutout of a human face. It seems to be caught in the rings
that circle the tan glass globe.
The great brass disk continues its revolution.
>x machine
The brass disk nearly fills the room. It rises at a sharp angle; its lower edge is a few inches
above the floor, but the opposite edge approaches the high roof. Intricate arcs and lines are
engraved across its surface, measuring you know not what. The disk turns with a slow, steady
rotation.
A large globe of blue glass is embedded at the disk's center. The globe bears a delicate pattern
of brown and white, like a map of islands in an impossible curved sea. The globe is fixed; the
disk rotates around it.
A silver wheel makes its own revolutions on the upper left side of the disk. Opposite it, on the
lower right side, a copper wheel turns. The wheels are also carried slowly around with the great
disk's motion. Each wheel bears its own colored globes.
The silver wheel whirls past the top of its orbit. The copper wheel, opposite it, is at its lowest.
>x blue globe
The blue globe rests, unmoving, at the center of the great brass machine. It is mottled with
delicate brown and white patterns -- as if the map of an island archipelago had been painted on
a sphere.
The great brass disk continues its revolution. The copper wheel is borne out of reach.
>x wheel
Which do you mean, the silver wheel or the copper wheel?
>x silver wheel
The silver wheel is engraved with spiralling moiré metrics. At its center, a globe of violet glass
rotates slowly. A smaller globe of tan is carried around the silver wheel's rim with its motion. The
tan globe is itself circled with heavy rings of frosted glass.
The silver wheel now occupies the upper right side of the great brass disk, as the engine
continues its stately revolution. The ringed tan globe is passing the outermost edge of the brass
disk.

>take tan globe
You grab hold of one of the globe's rings. Your hand knocks the blue mask loose, and it falls to
the floor.

...Memory stirs...
The rooflines of the city are slate over brick; but the tower is older stone. A silver-haired figure
looks down from an embrasured window. The largest building in view faces the tower, across
the square, perhaps in challenge. Its brick arches frame an intricate web wrought of iron. The
web shapes a symbol: an ornately styled crutch.
A small carved crutch hangs at the figure's throat; but this is simple, a few splinters of wood.
Absent fingers have smoothed the rough wood to a polish, here and there.
The people in the square do not look up; they go about their business quietly. Or -- all do but
one. One dark cloak is thrown down suddenly. A woman stands revealed in bright-dyed rags.
She is shouting, up at the tower, out through the square, around at the citizens who move away
from her. She spins, gesticulating. She points at the arched building; she points at the tower.
Above, looking down, a brow furrows beneath silver hair.
But the guards are coming, pushing through the crowd that melts away from the square. In
moments, the ragged woman too is cleared from sight.
The face in the window watches this. Not, perhaps, pleased; but satisfied enough. And then the
face turns away, back to the books and artifices within the stone tower.

North Alcove
This is a small, curved alcove, off a large chamber to the south. An archway to the north reveals
a flight of ascending stairs.
A pale gauzy rag is crumpled at the alcove's edge.
"But is it reality?" The question sparkles with unheeded eagerness; the questioner's gaze is
fiercely entangled among the turning rings and delicate gears.
"Of course it is not," comes the reply. "The model has not even the right form. The sky is not full
of wheels upon wheels. But--" overrunning the interruption "--that does not mean the model
lacks power." The voice is suddenly dry. "Symbolism and intent, child. What better symbol for
power than this: a machine just within our own limits of understanding?"
The machine clatters and whirrs.

It just looks like a pale dusty scrap, abandoned in a corner.

>x window
A broad glass pane -- inhumanly smooth and flawless -- looks out over a dark cavern.
This end of the corridor seems to be deep underground. A natural cave spreads out below; its
mammoth columns and cascades of flowstone are only dimly picked out by the candlelight
behind you. The farther reaches are hidden in darkness. But the shining waterfall before you is
easily visible. A stream pours in from your right, tumbles from a ledge, and plummets into a pit
beneath the window. The water seems to sparkle with some natural phosphorescence.

Dank Jungle (in the earthenware tub)
You are standing waist-deep in an empty earthenware tub, in the midst of a trackless jungle.
Heavy, entangled trunks and vines loom in every direction, as far as you can see -- and you

filters down to you. But golden flowers dot the trees, like bursts of sun.

Natural Passage
This is a narrow passageway, which winds between irregular stone walls into the world's

Darkness
Darkness is all around you... infinitely far away, and an inch from your groping hands.
[Oh, dear. You've walked into a very dark place.
(Yes, you were carrying a torch. Unfortunately you forgot to light it, so it isn't going to help much
-- unless you can light it right now, in the dark.)
Going "south" probably won't get you back; you can't tell directions in the dark. So what now?
One option is to type "undo". This will let you "back up" one move -- back to just before you
walked in here. Everything will be the same, except that you'll be in the Natural Passage, and
you'll be able to see.
In this game, you can only "undo" one move in a row. So if you do something else now (even
"look" or "south"), you won't be able to jump back to the lit Passage. The "undo" command is
intended only to fix immediate mistakes.
If you want to go back more than one turn, you'll have to use the "restart" or "restore"
commands. Type "help saving" for more information.
Or you could stumble around in the dark, and try to find your way out. Since this is an
introductory game, there is a way out. And maybe more to discover, as well.]

You are carrying a straw torch, an iron key, a scrap of gauze, a handful of warm berries, a
handful of cool berries, a glove (being worn), a knotted string, a desert landscape painting, a
stone, a crumpled white letter, a mountain landscape painting, a copper key, a quill pen, and
four masks (a blue mask, a gold mask, a brown mask, and a white mask).
You strain, hopelessly, to see anything. But perhaps your eyes are adjusting somewhat... there
is a dim glimmer of light in the distance.
>put orange berry on torch
You thrust the orange berry into the straw bundle. It bursts, spattering juice that immediately
flashes to flame. Sparks lodge throughout the straw... which crackles in response. In seconds
the torch is burning brightly.
You blink away dazzle-veils, and look around, trying to orient yourself.
Vaulting Cavern
A high, arched space opens around you, deep within the earth. The floor is unevenly
interspersed with stalagmites and stone columns; your torchlight glitters in droplets from the
stalactites above. Between the pale, hanging pinnacles of frozen stone, a vein of dark ore
streaks the vault.
A narrow passage leads away to the south. A broader one enters on the west side; it once
crossed the cave, but the eastern exit has collapsed. A low crawl runs northeast. At one edge of

fallen stone that descends to the water. A green mask is visible on the far shore.
>x river
The dark stream is three or four yards across. The water reflects the cave walls; you cannot see
beneath the surface. But you sense that it flows swiftly. Somewhere to the south, down the
river's passage, you can hear the water cascading down into some deeper abyss.
>put white berry in river
You toss a white berry into the water.
The response catches your breath away: planes of frost crackle across the river's surface.
Water eddies up around the obstruction, and is subsumed as quickly. The ice snaps and
groans, cracking and splitting and freezing again faster than you can follow.
In seconds, an uneven sheet of ice has formed across the entire width of the river. It seems
solid, although water hisses and bubbles underneath.
>w
Treading carefully, you cross the ice.
Far Shore of River
You have reached the western side of the subterranean river. A narrow shelf of loose rubble
slopes down to the water's frozen edge. The ice still spans the river, although it is slowly
wearing away in the silent current. The shore does not extend far up-stream or down; but at the
top of the slope, a narrow crawl leads southwest, away from the river-passage.
A green mask is lying in the scree.
You can see the upstream edge of the ice slowly, but steadily, wearing away in the current.

...Memory stirs...
A tent rests in mud; it is rigidly upright, defying its stains and any weariness. Once-gold laces
twitch against once-white cloth. Then a figure is emerging. It too is rigidly upright, stained and
dirtied, although the hair remains silver.
Facing the tent are four soldiers. The man they surround is a soldier too; but his red sashes are
hasty, crudely torn from some flag and stitched to a soldier's common clothes. He looks too
young for them.
The man carries no weapon, though his escorts eye him as if he might pull one out of any
puddle of mud. What he carries instead is a length of hacked wood with a shattered handle. He
kneels -- in the mud -- and lays it at the tall figure's feet.
The eyes that peer down from beneath silver hair seem only tired. The figure turns away, and
reaches for the tent flap again. But a fist clenches on the lacing; harsh yellow light splinters the
air.
A length of wood, which might once have been a crutch -- once, a war ago -- flares into fire,
ember, and ash.
The ice creaks alarmingly.
>loo
That's not a verb I recognize.

Far Shore of River
You have reached the western side of the subterranean river. A narrow shelf of loose rubble
slopes down to the water's frozen edge. The ice still spans the river, although it is thin and
beginning to crack. The shore does not extend far up-stream or down; but at the top of the
slope, a narrow crawl leads southwest, away from the river-passage.
>sw
River Crawl
You are crouched in a narrow twisting crawlway. A faint rushing sound, distant above you,
reveals that you are some way below the dark river. The crawl slopes upward to the northeast,
back the way you came, and angles even more sharply downward to the southeast.
>se
You continue crawling down the steepening slope. You soon find it difficult to maintain your
grip...
Then, with a horrible lurch of your stomach, you slip. The stone floor drops away entirely; your
torch goes spinning through empty space as you flail, falling, for a hold that is not there.
After a long second, you slam into a rocky ledge.
Ledge in Pit
You are balanced on a ledge, leaning against the wall of a twisty, irregular pit. Across from you,
and slightly above, you can see a narrow opening in the wall. A climbable rough path leads
upward. You might be able to descend further, but the pit beneath you is nearly vertical, and the
stone is damp and slippery with condensation.
A warm breath of air rises slowly up the pit, steadily, carrying with it an eddying stream of mist.
Your torch, thankfully, has landed nearby.
>take torch
You pick up the flaming torch.
>x walls
The pit walls are misted with damp condensation.
>x pit

You slowly inch your way down the pit.
Deep in Pit
The shaft is roughly vertical here, and you cling to holds in the wall, hoping desperately that you
do not slip. Below you, the pit narrows even further; the smooth walls glisten with moisture. The
climb above looks marginally safer.
A warm breath of air rises slowly up the pit, steadily, carrying with it an eddying stream of mist.
>put white berry in pit
The white berry vanishes into the depths, glancing crystalline motes from the stone as it falls.
Almost immediately, an icy crackle resounds from far below. The warm mist turns in an instant
to a hard glitter in the air, as a wave of cold billows up the pit. The walls bloom white into frost.

You brace your knees and back against the smooth stone, one way and the other, and begin
the slow descent.
Depths of Pit
You hang in a narrow shaft, wedged knees-to-back between the walls. One hand clutches your
torch; with the other, you cling to an angle in the rock. You are certain you cannot keep hold
here for long.
You see a tarnished bracelet before you, wedged into a hollow in the pit wall.
Below you, the shaft widens out -- an impossible descent, which leads only to a bubbling
underground pool, jagged with rocks and shattered ice.
The frozen pool is visibly melting. A wisp of steam rises past you now.
>take braclet
You can't see any such thing.
>take bracelet
You steady your hold, lean slightly forwards, and manage to pop the tarnished bracelet out of its
hollow. Even better, you manage not to drop it down the shaft.

Vaulting Cavern
A high, arched space opens around you, deep within the earth. The floor is unevenly
interspersed with stalagmites and stone columns; your torchlight glitters in droplets from the
stalactites above. Between the pale, hanging pinnacles of frozen stone, a vein of dark ore
streaks the vault.
A narrow passage leads away to the south. A broader one enters on the west side; it once
crossed the cave, but the eastern exit has collapsed. A low crawl runs northeast. At one edge of
the cave, a pit descends abruptly. Wisps of steam rise from its depths.
The steam thickens.
>x bracelet
You see a broad band of darkly tarnished metal -- you cannot tell what metal -- an incomplete
ring, so that it may easily be slipped on and off. The outer surface is finely engraved with a
curving, cross-grained pattern.

Confusing Passage
The passageway runs from southwest to northeast, more or less. Great columns and masses of
stone rise from floor to ceiling; the tunnel divides and enjoins around them, a confusing wrangle
of minor branches.
>x columns
Stalactites are the ones on the ceiling. Stalagmites are the ones on the floor. You don't know
how you know this.
"The technique of the memory palace is commonplace," says a voice you remember, "not just
among wizards, but in all the mantic disciplines. One commonly uses one's home as an anchor:
familiar rooms, passages, possessions become the keys to organized thought and knowledge.
By passing through the house-in-mind, one passes unerringly through memory."
"Of course, among wizards, the technique may be elevated to a new plane."
>ne
You pick your way through the stone formations.
Dead End
The passage from the southwest comes to an abrupt end here, in a round, water-worn alcove.
The eastern wall is of dressed granite -- an intrusion in these deep natural caverns. A heavy iron
door is set into the wall; it is tightly shut.
>x door
The door is a massive iron affair with a high sill. It has no keyhole, only an iron bar for a handle.
The door is closed.
>open door
You push on the door -- and then set yourself and heave again; for it is as massive as it looks,
and weighted to close of its own accord. By leaning hard against the iron, you get it open. Light
pours from the other side -- gentle, but still bright after your torchlit exploration.
>e
You dodge through the slowly closing door.
Cistern, West
You are at the edge of an immense and empty elliptical chamber. The walls are of granite
blocks, tightly fitted and dressed, bare of window or ornament. It feels like a vast cistern, not a
place for human habitation. The only exit is the door directly west.
The floor is a flat, perfect plane of black stone... or metal... or glass. You can't tell what it is. The
roof, far above, is an equally flat and perfect surface of featureless, luminescent white. Both
spread out eastward, defining the chamber between them. And halfway in between, a glass
catwalk runs around the wall, girdling the room.
A black column rises along the east wall, from the black floor up to the catwalk.
The iron door swings to with a faint boom.
>x floor
The floor is a black, blank ellipse. The surface seems like it should be reflective, but you can
see no reflection within it -- not even the soft glare of the roof.
>x ceiling
The ceiling is a white ellipse, remote and blank. It radiates a featureless white glow, which
illuminates the chamber -- a perfect and shadowless light.
A catwalk is hung around the perimeter wall, well below the ceiling, though far above you.
>x catwalk
The catwalk is far above you, though only halfway to the luminescent ceiling. It seems to be a
single elliptical pathway of glass, running most of the way around the perimeter of the room. The
glass, or crystal, is colorless and impossibly clear... but not perfect; you think you can see
cracks. It's difficult to tell from down here.
You can see a small red shape -- another mask -- resting on the catwalk, at the east edge of its
ellipse.
>x red mask
The red mask is on the catwalk, high above the eastern side of the room. You can see it clearly
through the glass.
[If you want a hint on getting the red mask, type "help hint".]
>help hint
Asking for a hint?
THE DREAMHOLD has an extensive hint system, which covers all the puzzles in the main
storyline. (There are quite a few discoveries which are left for you to make on your own! But
those are all optional. You can get hints on everything which you need to reach the end of the
game.)
If you type "help hint" again, you will get a hint on your current situation. You can use this
command anywhere in the game. If there's an unsolved puzzle nearby, the hint will address it; if
not, you'll be given general guidance.
But remember, hints always spoil the fun -- at least a little bit. You might be able to work it out
yourself if you keep trying. Only type "help hint" if you really think you're stuck.

Cistern, West
You are at the edge of an immense and empty elliptical chamber. The walls are of granite
blocks, tightly fitted and dressed, bare of window or ornament. It feels like a vast cistern, not a
place for human habitation. The only exit is the closed door directly west.
The floor is a flat, perfect plane of black. The roof, far above, is an equally flat and perfect
surface of featureless, luminescent white. Both spread out eastward, defining the chamber
between them. And halfway in between, a glass catwalk runs around the wall, girdling the room.
A black column rises along the east wall, from the black floor up to the catwalk.
>e
Cistern, East
You are at the eastern side of the elliptical cistern, standing next to a low glass platform. The
platform is about three strides across; it juts out from the granite wall, a bare inch above the
dead-black floor.
High above you, a glass catwalk runs around the room's perimeter.
A black column rises along the east wall, from the black floor up to the catwalk. It passes just to
the right of the platform.
A heavy iron lever rises from the platform, by the wall.
>x lever
The lever is just a plain iron bar. Its base is clearly a socket, although you cannot see what
mechanism it connects to -- the glass beneath it is oddly shadowed.
>pull lever
(first stepping onto the glass platform)
You pull the lever, which clunks stiffly down. The clunk is echoed from below you.
A curious thick gurgle sounds, somewhere below you.
>stand
You step from the platform down onto the black surface.
The gurgle is louder now.
>z
Time passes.
Suddenly, the black surface beneath you -- the entire floor -- begins sinking away, in ripples, like
draining oil. The black column lengthens (or is uncovered) as it goes. The true bottom of the
cistern is quickly revealed: a deep, sloping well, lined with granite blocks, as the walls are.
You are borne down with the tide, until the last few courses of stone emerge from the blackness
beneath your feet.
Cistern, Bottom
You are at the bottom of the cistern, at the edge, where the down-sloping floor meets the east
wall. Directly above you hangs the glass platform; yards above that, the catwalk
circumnavigates the room; and above that, the white ellipse of the ceiling spreads its featureless
radiance.
A black column rises along the east wall, from the floor up to the catwalk. It passes just to the
right of the platform.
At the lowest angle of the floor, just by the wall, you see a black circle -- a small disk of the
featureless substance which once floored this entire chamber. The black column merges into its
rim.
A heavy iron wheel is set into the eastern wall.
>x wheel
The wheel is supported on a thick hub which protrudes from the wall. The edge is deeply
notched, as if the wheel were meant to be gripped and turned -- it reminds you of a ship's
rudderwheel.
>turn wheel
You spin the wheel to the left until it stops. A faint vibration within the metal -- perceptible only
when you laid hands on it -- slowly stills.
Between a breath and a breath, the black column vanishes. It goes from the top end down -- like
a rope cut loose from the catwalk, slithering straight down into the well without a waver or a
splash.
The remaining circle of black sinks away, revealing a brass grating at the bottom of the slope.
You now see a line of handholds -- a ladder -- cut into the wall, where the column previously
rose. They ascend from the cistern's bottom, where you stand, past the glass platform, up to the
catwalk.
>x lader
You can't see any such thing.
>x ladder
They're just shaped hollows in the granite.

It's a round slab of rough hammered brass, pierced by finger-sized holes. You can see only

Handholds cut into the wall, to the right of the platform, form a ladder leading both up and down.
A heavy iron lever rises from the platform, by the wall.
>u
Cistern Catwalk, East
You stand on the catwalk -- or rather, in the catwalk. The glass surface is curved, forming a
shallow trough. It begins here, on the east side of the cistern, and follows the wall around to the
north.
Just past the end of the catwalk, a ladder runs down the wall.
A heavy brass pipe protrudes from the wall, between the catwalk and the ladder. The end of the
pipe is a curved fitting, which ends in a graceful brass spout. But the spout does not point down;
it curves to the right, towards the ladder.
A red mask is lying in the trough.
>x red nask
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the red mask.
>x red mask
It looks like a red paper mask, half life-size. But its curves are only delicate shading; the mask is

...Memory stirs...
True and heavy beams of wood frame the hall; it is dominated by a high table. At the head of
the table, a tall figure stands -- silver hair, intricately stitched robes -- drawing all eyes.
A sharp gesture. To one side, a half-grown boy frowns, tries to ask a question. He is shushed
fiercely and without a glance.
At the door, uniformed guards carry in a bundle of cloth. The silver-haired figure stares at it --
stares at it for long moments.
A guard, moved finally by the silence, unfolds the cloth. Eyes jerk; but there is still no sound.
Eventually, the tall figure moves a hand again. The wet red stains that have been revealed
sparkle, glow, and slowly vanish from the cloth. It is only a gesture; it is all anyone can do; it is
nothing.
Muffling a cry, the boy leaps up and limps for the door. Hurrying, his uneven steps are more halt
than usual. His face twists in pain; but no one moves to help him.
>look
Cistern Catwalk, East
You stand on the catwalk -- or rather, in the catwalk. The glass surface is curved, forming a
shallow trough. It begins here, on the east side of the cistern, and follows the wall around to the
north.
Just past the end of the catwalk, a ladder runs down the wall.
A heavy brass pipe protrudes from the wall, between the catwalk and the ladder. The end of the
pipe is a curved fitting, which ends in a graceful brass spout. But the spout does not point down;
it curves to the right, towards the ladder.
>x catwalk
The catwalk is a shallow glass trough, a yard wide and perhaps a foot deep. It begins here, and
seems to curve almost all the way around the room at this level.
The glass is thick and clear, but somewhat uneven at the edges -- small chips and cracks mar it.
>x pipe
The pipe is a thick tube of hammered brass, with heavy fittings. It extends about a foot from the
wall; it is just beyond the catwalk's end and just above the catwalk's level. The end of the pipe is
a graceful curved spout, which bends towards the ladder.
The spout looks slightly loose on its fitting, as if you could turn it.
>turn pipe
You rotate the spout to the left. It now curves out over the catwalk.

Cistern Catwalk, Northeast
You stand in the glass trough, on the northeast side of its arc. It runs northwest and southeast

A large, curved slab of glass is leaning in the trough here. It rests on edge, nearly upright,
although the way it wedges against the sides keeps it from falling.
You can also see two blobs of gum (a small gum blob and a big gum blob) here.
>x slab
The glass slab is irregular, a foot wide and a few feet long. It has a gentle, even curve along its
length. The slab is standing edge-up in the trough, crossing it from side to side.
>x blob

but it does not pass through -- it seems to be blocked by a gauzy pale film that coats the brass.
Instead, the blackness spills up and over the edges of the catwalk, joining the black column
beneath your feet.
A crumpled black wad is lying here, barely visible against the catwalk.
>take black wad
You pluck the wad from the catwalk, and try to smooth it out. It proves to be a chart, incised with
fine white lines and lettering.
>x chart
The chart depicts ruling dynasties through time. Its lettering is inhumanly precise, etched in
white on an odd black material. The chart's scale is so large that individual names do not
appear; single lives are only jogs and serifs in the asterisms of descent.
You recognize a few of the family names, a few of the countries and states and kingdoms -- not
many, and all seem distant and unimportant. But your eye is drawn to a rift in the middle of the
chart. Many lines end there. New lines begin beyond it. Dynasties across the world seem to
break or shear from that brief stretch... though "brief" is an interval of centuries, if you read the
scale correctly.
A concise note by the rift reads: "Colloquially, the Silver Demon Age. Plague? War? Widespread
turmoil and political instability. Records unusually rare from this era."
And below that, in a different and familiar scrawl: "History is larger than any one man: this
therefore is no history."

Cistern Catwalk, Northeast
You stand on the black surface which fills the catwalk. It runs northwest and southeast from
here.
A black column descends from the catwalk on the southeast side of the room.
>s
Cistern Catwalk, East
You stand on the catwalk -- or rather, on the black substance which fills the catwalk's trough. It
begins here, on the east side of the cistern, and follows the wall around to the north.
A black column descends from the catwalk on the southeast side of the room.
Just past the end of the catwalk, a ladder runs down the wall.
A heavy brass pipe protrudes from the wall, between the catwalk and the ladder. The spout on
the end of the pipe curves left, towards the catwalk. An arc of the blackness falls from the spout;
it merges seamlessly into the black substance which fills the trough.
>d
You shift yourself to the handholds and descend.
Cistern, East (on the glass platform)
You are standing on a glass platform at the eastern side of the elliptical cistern. The platform is
about three strides across; it juts out over a deep well.
High above you, a glass catwalk runs around the room's perimeter.
A black column descends along the southeast wall, from the catwalk down to the floor, and then
down the slope to the bottom of the room.
Handholds cut into the wall, to the right of the platform, form a ladder leading both up and down.
A heavy iron lever rises from the platform, by the wall.
>d
Cistern, Bottom
You are at the bottom of the cistern, at the edge, where the down-sloping floor meets the east
wall. Directly above you hangs the glass platform; yards above that, the catwalk
circumnavigates the room; and above that, the white ellipse of the ceiling spreads its featureless
radiance.
A black column descends along the southeast wall, from the catwalk down to the floor, and then
down the slope to the bottom of the room.
At the lowest angle of the floor, just by the wall, you see a black circle -- a small disk of the
featureless substance which once floored this entire chamber. The black column angles down
the slope to merge with its rim.
Simple handholds cut into the wall form a ladder leading upwards.
A heavy iron wheel is set into the eastern wall.
>turn wheel
You spin the wheel to the left until it stops. A faint vibration within the metal -- perceptible only
when you laid hands on it -- slowly stills.
Between a breath and a breath, the black column vanishes. It goes from the top end down -- like
a rope cut loose from the catwalk, slithering straight down into the well without a waver or a
splash.
The remaining circle of black sinks away, revealing a brass grating at the bottom of the slope.
>w
You walk up the slope.
Cistern, West
You are at the edge of an immense and empty elliptical chamber. The walls are of granite
blocks, tightly fitted and dressed, bare of window or ornament. It feels like a vast cistern, not a
place for human habitation. The only exit is the closed door directly west.
The stone floor is level where you stand, but to the east it slopes sharply down. The roof, far
above, is a flat and perfect surface of featureless, luminescent white. Halfway up to it, a glass
catwalk runs around the wall, girdling the room.
A brass grate is set into the the floor near the door.
>put rag on grate
You begin spreading the circle of gauze across the grating. It clings, and seems almost to shift
in your fingers; and now you see that the holes in the pale web line up precisely with the holes
in the brass beneath it. In a few moments, the grating is entirely covered.
>e
You walk down the angled floor.
Cistern, Bottom
You are at the bottom of the cistern, at the edge, where the down-sloping floor meets the east
wall. Directly above you hangs the glass platform; yards above that, the catwalk
circumnavigates the room; and above that, the white ellipse of the ceiling spreads its featureless
radiance.
A brass grate is set into the lowest angle of the floor, just by the wall.

A heavy iron wheel is set into the eastern wall.
>turn wheel
You spin the wheel to the right until it stops. As you do, a faint, unsteady vibration grows in the
metal.
The black column reappears: spilling down from the catwalk on the southeast side of the room,
to the floor, and then down the slope, in one dark silent fall.
The bottom of the cistern begins filling once again with the black substance. It ripples outward
from the base of the column.
The black tide rises under your feet, bearing you upward. In moments, the platform is covered;
and the catwalk is approaching; and then the catwalk is submerged as well. The tide lifts you
towards the shining roof.
>d
Up seems more likely.
The black floor continues to rise, and you along with it.
>x ceiling
The ceiling is a white ellipse, remote and blank. It radiates a featureless white glow, which
illuminates the chamber -- a perfect and shadowless light.
Your ascent continues. The chamber is beginning to seem much less lofty than it once was.
>c floor
That's not a verb I recognize.
>x floor
The floor is a black, blank ellipse. The surface seems like it should be reflective, but you can
see no reflection within it -- not even the soft glare of the roof.
The bright glow of the roof is getting closer.
>w
The door is gone, submerged. You see no other way out of the cistern chamber.
The roof is nearly within reach now.
You glance around in panic. You still can't see any way out.
>z
Time passes.
The black floor and the white ceiling meet, and merge. The infinitesmal gap, too narrow even for
a ray of light or darkness, excludes all possibility; within that moment you see all your own time,
moving more swiftly than thought.
Nothing is simpler, for that moment, than to move into it.
Grey Chamber
This space forms an ellipse around you; but the walls are featureless, and the planes above and
below are indistinct, indistinguishable. You do not recognize this world. Even the silence is not
the silence of the caverns. Your movements raise no echo.
A small gap to the west reveals an opening to more familiar stone and darkness.
A shield, a gleaming triangular buckler, hangs between floor and roof. Its bright lines are the
only sharp edges about this place.
> x sheild
You can't see any such thing.
>x shield
The buckler is a small, slightly curved triangle of bright metal. Its face is bossed with the image
of three crossed spears. The back is less polished, and lacks the straps you would expect.
>take sheild
You can't see any such thing.
>take sheild

Even your breathing is muffled. If indeed you do breathe, here. You are suddenly unsure.

You take a startling gasp of a breath. Had you not been breathing?

You hear nothing at all.

below are indistinct, indistinguishable. You do not recognize this world. Even the silence is not
the silence of the caverns. Your movements raise no echo.
A small gap to the west reveals an opening to more familiar stone and darkness.
Time seems to thicken and slow around you.
>x gap
To the west, a passage of familiar, water-sculpted stone leads away from this place.
>w
You creep into the gap. The air seems to change around you, to the common cool damp of the
caverns. In moments, you emerge -- into a familiar confusion of stone. You look behind you,
trying to remember which passage let you free.
Confusing Passage
The passageway runs from southwest to northeast, more or less. Great columns and masses of
stone rise from floor to ceiling; the tunnel divides and enjoins around them, a confusing wrangle
of minor branches.
A small gap is visible in the stone to the southeast.
>put white berry on torch
You drop a white berry into the burning straw. An odd blue light crackles through the flame, and
for a moment you feel a lancing chill. Then the fire is quenched -- and all light drains away in an
instant.
Darkness
It is utterly dark... the darkness of the spaces within the world.
>z
Time passes.
You strain, hopelessly, to see anything. But perhaps your eyes are adjusting somewhat... there
is a dim glimmer of light in the distance.
>x light
A faint light blooms, somewhere in the distance, in the dark. Your sense of direction is
hopelessly muddled, but it could be a reflection of a reflection of light on stone -- the passage by
which you entered this place.
>enter light
You move towards the light, slowly; feeling each step in the dark, as if an unseen slope or pit
were waiting. Which may be.
After a time, the light seems stronger.
Darkness
Darkness is all around you... infinitely far away, and an inch from your groping hands.
But you can make out the faintest glimmer of light, somewhere.
>leave light
You set your back to the light, as best you can. And you move, slowly -- reaching ahead with
every step -- into the empty and utter dark.
The trace of light dims behind you.
Darkness
You are somewhere within utter darkness, somewhere within the earth.
But you can make out the faintest glimmer of light, somewhere.

You stumble on an unseen unevenness in the stone. And you steady, trying to catch your
balance, and continue onward.
The trace of light dims behind you.
Darkness
You are somewhere within utter darkness, somewhere within the earth.
But you can make out the faintest glimmer of light, somewhere.
[You are lost in the dark.
It's a frightening situation, but one you will inevitably fall into, from time to time. The best
defense is to carry a light source -- but it's too late for that now. (Unless you can put one
together from the items you're carrying.) You'll have to find a way back to the lit world.
In some games, wandering around in the dark is very dangerous. There can be monsters, or
bottomless pits. However, this game's darkness is safe... relatively safe.]

>g
Something moves against the face of the darkness.
But it is not light.
Subterrane World
The world is picked out, not in shades or tints or degrees of black; but in qualities of darkness.
Each has a name; each whispers to you.
In utter night, you sense the cavernous space around you -- vaulted roof as clear in the
darkness as the rough-hewn floor. Without sight, you perceive behemoth columns of stone,
shaped to perfect smoothness and standing in perfect circular array. Eyeless, you are aware of
the vast carved form high above.
In the center of the stone circle is an acute angle of darkness: a dagger, balanced on its point.
>take dagger
You reach out (your hand, you suddenly notice, is the only indistinct form in this sightlessness)
and seize the dagger's hilt.
It is surprisingly heavy; and the hilt is obsidian, glassy-smooth against your fingers. But your
attention is gripped by the rent which the blade leaves behind -- a narrow crack of emptiness
against darkness.
[An extra discovery has been added to your score.]
>x rent
The rent stretches from the floor to higher than you can reach, but it is narrow as... how narrow
is it? It seems, perhaps, like an infinite plane turned edge-on to your odd perception.
>enter rent
You move towards the rent.
The darkness parts around you. What remains is not light; but a flickering motion, and a sound
as of the voice of fluting wind...
...and then the flickering is light; ordinary, flickering flames, which illuminate a comfortably
familiar room.
Sitting Room (on the settee)
This room seems more inviting. The walls are painted with delicate patterns of flowers, which
merge into a soft-hued carpet beneath your feet. Two chairs and a cushioned settee face a
bright-flickering fireplace on the far wall.
You see an empty hook above the fireplace.
You see doorways to the south and in the southeast corner of the room. A white-painted door to
the east is open.
>x setter
You can't see any such thing.
>x settee
In the center of the room, a wide settee faces the fireplace. Its drapes and cushions are
swathed in velvet of worn eggshell-green.
>look under settee
Not even dust.
>x fireplace
If you doubted this was a dreamhold, you're certain now... the fireplace holds no wood, no ash.
An odd basket of coiled silver wire holds a heap of glassy, glowing, cherry-red spheres.
Insubstantial flames flicker above the spheres, and a mild warmth touches your face and body.
But the spheres do not truly burn; they are not consumed.
>take sphere
With your gloved hand, you pluck one sphere from the glowing heap. Almost immediately, its
red light fades, leaving a dim grey glassiness.
Hmm. You cautiously hold your other hand above the grey sphere, then touch it. You feel only
cool glass.
>e
You'll have to get off the settee first.
>s
You'll have to get off the settee first.

Curving Hall
You are in a high, dim corridor, walled in cracked and moldering plaster. The only light comes
from tiny flickering candles above. The hall curves gently around from the south to the
northwest. You see an open door to the west; archways open to the northeast and east.
>s
Curving Hall, South End
The curving corridor ends here. The blank plaster wall to the south features a large window;
sunlight pours in, brightening this end of the hall. You can go through the archway to the east,
take the stairs which ascend to the west, or return north along the corridor.
>w
You ascend the stairs.
Dark Dome, East
You stand at the east edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the west, arching into an
immense dome. A diffuse illumination spreads across the lower reaches, barely bright enough
to see by.
There is an open archway to the east; beyond it, stairs descend. You can also see a ladder in
the distance, at the north edge of the dome.
>w
Dark Dome, Center
You stand at the center of a vast round space. An immense dome arches above you. A diffuse
illumination spreads across the lower reaches, barely bright enough to see by.
In the distance to the east, you can see a doorway; a ladder is visible far to the north.
In the center of the floor sits an odd basket of coiled silver wire. The metal pyramid that covered
the basket lies open, leaning to one side.
>put sphere in basket
As you drop the grey sphere into the basket, its glassy surface flares with a brilliant white light.
You shield your eyes as the dome is flooded with light.
>x dome
The dome is filled with white light.
The light from the sphere fades smoothly to a vivid gold.

>g

>close pyramid
You heave the pyramid back upright, covering the basket. The black light from the sphere is cut
off; but gradually you see patterns in the darkness above you.
The dome is now filled with familiar stars. Among the constellations, you can see the Iron Moth
to the north; Parhu's Galley and Juinua's Wall to the east; the Cloak of Night and the Southern
Axe to the south; the Doorstep of Heaven to the west; and the Crutch and the Bull-and-Cow
directly above you.
>x crutch
The Crutch is a bright zig-zag of stars high overhead. King Maijnir the Farsighted quarrelled with
his son Walking Boy. He wounded Walking Boy's foot, and then exiled him to walk the
boundaries of his kingdom, bearing only rags, tatters, and a crutch of gold.
>x bull
The Bull and Cow are small star-groups near the zenith. Jernos desired Seroa, the wife of the
Southern king. She turned herself into a sparrow and fled; he turned himself into a horhawk and
followed her. Seroa hid herself in many other shapes, but each time Jernos changed into
something that could find her. Finally she turned herself into a bull. Jernos turned into a cow, but
a cow was too stupid to chase Seroa further. Seroa-the-bull mounted the Jernos-the-cow and
sired eight brass calves.
You've never been quite sure what the moral of that story was supposed to be.
>w
Starry Dome, West
You stand at the west edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the east, arching into an
immense dome. The dome is filled with familiar stars.
Among the stars in the western sky, you see the constellation of the Doorstep of Heaven.
At the north edge of the dome, off in the distance, you can see a ladder. All the way across the
dome to the east, a doorway is barely visible.
>x doorstep
The Doorstep of Heaven is a near-perfect circle of stars in the western sky. It marks the gate, or
guards the gate, through which the dead travel to the All-Place. Funereal ceremonies always
begin when the Doorstep rises, day or night.
>
Starry Dome, South
You stand at the south edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the north, arching into an
immense dome. The dome is filled with familiar stars.
Among the stars in the southern sky, you see the constellations of the Cloak of Night and the
Southern Axe.
At the east edge of the dome, off in the distance, you can see a doorway. All the way across the
dome to the north, a ladder is barely visible.
>x cloak. take it. x it. wear it.
The Cloak of Night is a ragged patch of starless dark, low in the south, just above the horizon.
The Lady of Summer leaves it lying there half the year, while she dances. In winter she takes up
her cloak to wrap herself, as she sits by the fire to tell stories.
The Cloak is low on the dome, just above your head. It seems low enough to touch.
You reach up and pull. Heavy, black cloth flows silently down into your arms.
It's a heavy armful of black cloth. Black, blacker -- blacker than that. But light, like twinkling dust,
drifts in the deepest folds.
You swing the cloak around yourself. It is not so heavy on your shoulders; but warm, very warm.
[An extra discovery has been added to your score.]
>x axe. e.
An irregular double-curve of stars, high in the south, the Axe takes the form of the traditional
southern weapon. The Hero of Torcova lived so close to his axe that the storymongers called it
his wife. (Fortunately for them, he was a hero.) When he was mortally wounded at Deven, the
axe agreed to die in his place. The Hero remained nameless in Torcova, awaiting the greatest
battle to come, and the axe moved towards Heaven.
Starry Dome, East
You stand at the east edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the west, arching into an
immense dome. The dome is filled with familiar stars.
Among the stars in the eastern sky, you see the constellations of Parhu's Galley and Juinua's
Wall.
There is an open archway to the east; beyond it, stairs descend. You can also see a ladder in
the distance, at the north edge of the dome.
>x galley. x wall. n.
Parhu's Galley is visible to the east. A row of dim stars mark the oars of the galley slaves. Parhu
flung himself into the sea and drowned, but he did not rescind his oath, and so his slaves are
bound to row forever after Parhu's Ruby, the red star beyond the Galley's prow.
The stars of Juinua's Wall run high above the eastern horizon. Juinua of Junorr was given a
prophecy, that her blood would stain the walls of Junorr before her thirtieth year. Instead of
tearing down the city wall, she ordered it built higher -- a new course of great stones every year.
In her twenty-ninth year, she was crushed by a stone as she supervised the work on the wall.
Or, depending who tells the tale, she died giving birth to a stone; or she was murdered by the
master builder; or she died of the flux in an overcrowded city street.
Starry Dome, North
You stand at the north edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the south, arching into an
immense dome. The dome is filled with familiar stars.
Among the stars in the northern sky, you see the constellation of the Iron Moth.
A ladder reaches both upwards and downwards from here, passing through openings in the
floor and in the dome's skirt. You can also see a doorway off in the distance, at the far east
edge of the dome.
>x moth. u.
The stars of the Iron Moth hang high in the northern sky. The Moth never sets; it flutters
constantly around and around the Utter North, which is always near its bright left antenna.
Lodestones are dust from the Moth's wing.
You climb up, through the dome, and a long way farther...
Translucent Dome
You are in a small round dome, much smaller than the vast dark space below. The curving
surface is translucent, bright with the daylight filtering in from outside. The floor beneath your
feet is a harsh metal grating. The ladder runs from a hole in the grating, near the south side, up
to a matching opening in the dome above.
A low platform fills the center of the floor. The platform is piled high with split lengths of wood.
A tall triangle of beaten copper rises along the north side of the dome.
>x dome. x platform. x triangle. x track. u.
Daylight gives the dome a soft white glow, although you can see nothing outside.
The wood is laid out in an immense, semicircular heap. It looks like nothing so much as a
bonfire, ready for the spark.
(the tall copper triangle)
It is a thin sheet of hammered copper, as wide at the base as your outstretched arms. The sheet
tapers as it rises, curving inward as it hugs the dome's inner surface. Its peak is halfway up the
dome. The shape reminds you of a billowing sail.
The copper triangle stands to the north, but its base rests in a narrow track that runs all the way
around the dome.
A narrow circular track runs around the room, a bare finger's width from the dome's lower edge.
The copper sail rests in this track on the north side of the dome.
You climb up and out.
Catwalk, South
This railless catwalk circles the outer edge of a pale dome. You stand at the southern edge of
the circle; the catwalk disappears around the dome to the east and west. A few iron steps lead
up to an opening in the dome, from which a ladder descends inside.
The dome is nestled high on the shoulder of a sunlit mountain peak. Below you, a small terrace
is filled with knotted and spiralled garden paths. And far below that, green and bright, a lush
valley spreads out into the distance.
>x terrace. x valley. w.
A garden is visible below and to the south -- nestled in a terrace, well below the dome, though
still high on the mountain's flank. The paths and plantings are tiny from this vantage. At the far
edge of the garden a balcony looks out, as you do, over the green and sunlit valley.
The valley is infinite in detail, though bounded by stone. The trees are spread in afternoon
sunlight.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving west around the dome.
Catwalk, West
You are at the western edge of a catwalk which circles a pale dome. The dome rises from the
face of a sunlit mountain peak, which towers to the north. To the south, the stone slopes
descend to a wide valley, shining green in the afternoon light.
> x mountain. n.
(the mountain landscape painting)
The painting shows a tiny rock pool amid jagged mountain peaks. The landscape is harsh and
unforgiving, but the pool seems a respite. It is rimmed with bright moss, and a few fish-like
shadows are visible in its depths.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving north around the dome.
Catwalk, North
You stand on a narrow, railless catwalk, which girdles the translucent dome to the south. To the
north, the mountain rises massively above you. But the dome stands on its own promontory; the
mountain face is several yards away. The ravine between dome and mountain is deep and
jagged.
There is a tiny ledge on the face of the mountain. You can just make out a black mask balanced
on the ledge.
>x ravine. x ledge. x black mask. jump over ravine. x dome. e.
There is a gap, several yards wide, between the body of the mountain and the outcropping that
supports the dome. Gazing down, you can see only that the ravine's bottom is very narrow;
jagged rocks are mercilessly visible.
It's just a narrow ledge which juts from the mountainside, across the ravine from you. There is a
black mask balanced on the ledge.
The black mask looks like a black paper cutout of a human face. It is resting on a thin ledge on
the mountainside, across the ravine to the north.
The ravine is much too wide.
The dome crouches above you to the south. The milky surface prevents you from seeing inside;
sunlight diffuses across the dome as if it were mist. You can just make out a triangular
silhouette within the dome's surface -- the outline of the copper sail.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving east around the dome.
Catwalk, East
You are at the eastern edge of a catwalk which circles a pale dome. The dome rises from the
face of a sunlit mountain peak, which towers to the north. To the south, the stone slopes fall to a
verdant valley.

>put orange berry on platform.
You toss the orange berry into the heaped wood. It bursts and flares, spattering sparks of fiery
juice. The wood crackles, slow to catch... but, after a few moments, a tongue of flame is licking
up through the pile.
A few moments more, and the heap is a roaring bonfire. You blink, turning from the intense
heat.
>x fire. u.
The wood blazes away, filling the dome with light, heat, and smoke.
The quality of the light outside changes subtly.
The sky fades to night as you climb.
Catwalk, South; Night
This railless catwalk circles the outer edge of a pale dome, which is illuminated from within. You
stand at the southern edge of the circle; the catwalk disappears around the dome to the east
and west. A few iron steps lead up to an opening in the dome, from which a ladder descends
inside.
The dome is nestled high on the shoulder of a moonlit mountain peak. Below you, a small
terrace is filled with knotted and spiralled garden paths. And far below that, green and dim, a
lush valley spreads away into the night.
>x dome. x valley. x garden. x mountain. x sky. x moon. x stars. w. n.
The dome crouches above you to the north. The milky surface prevents you from seeing inside,
but firelight chases itself across the entire dome, illuminating the catwalk amid the darkness of
night. There is an opening in the dome here, and a ladder leading down inside.
The valley is infinite in detail, though bounded by stone. The trees sleep, almost invisible in the
night's gloom.
A garden is visible below and to the south -- nestled in a terrace, well below the dome, though
still high on the mountain's flank. The paths and plantings are tiny from this vantage. At the far
edge of the garden a balcony looks out, as you do, over the shadowy moonlit valley.
(the mountain landscape painting)
The painting shows a tiny rock pool amid jagged mountain peaks. The landscape is harsh and

shadows are visible in its depths.
The sky is black, but clear, hung thickly with stars. You find, with calm surprise, that you can
recognize constellations. The moon is well risen, and surrounded by a halo.
The moon is full, rising in the southeast. A trace of unseen cloud must ride the air, for a halo of
pale light circles the moon's face.
The sky is filled with familiar stars. Among the constellations, you can see the Iron Moth to the
north; Parhu's Galley and Juinua's Wall to the east; the Southern Axe to the south; the Doorstep
of Heaven to the west; and the Crutch and the Bull-and-Cow at the zenith.
The stars, it seems, are in your memory. Even if your life is not.

The copper sail inside the dome is visible here, a dark silhouette. It blocks the firelight; a long
black shadow falls north across the catwalk and out into the empty air.
>x dome. x sail. x shadow. touch it. put stone on shadow. n.
The dome crouches above you to the south. The milky surface prevents you from seeing inside,
but firelight chases itself across the entire dome, illuminating the catwalk amid the darkness of
night. A triangular outline is silhouetted against the dome's light -- the shadow of the copper sail.
The top of the copper sail is visible through the dome's surface, as a triangular silhouette, dark
against the firelight. The sail's shadow falls black across the catwalk. Unusually black: it's a strip
of unrelieved darkness which stretches out to the north, into empty space.
The shadow of the sail is an immensely elongated triangle, stretching out to the north, across
the catwalk and out into space. It's odd, in fact, how it seems to hang in the air. A strip of utter
black beyond the catwalk, reaching as far as the mountain face...
You kneel, and tentatively reach toward the blackness, where it hangs in the air beyond the
catwalk. And you feel resistance. The shadow is not exactly solid; but you cannot push your
hand down through it.
You toss the stone off the catwalk, onto the shadow. It comes silently to rest there. You bend
and pick it up again; the shadow seems strong enough to bear weight.
You edge one foot forward onto the path of black shadow. It feels... not substantial, but
somehow resistant to your probing. You gingerly press down. The shadow bears your weight.
Clenching your fists -- wishing for a handrail -- you take a step forward.
And another. In a few strides, you have crossed the ravine.
Ledge; Night
You are standing at the end of a long, black tongue of shadow which hangs incomprehensibly in
empty air. The strip of darkness bridges a deep ravine between a fire-lit dome to the south, and
the cliff-face of a towering mountain, to the north.
A narrow ledge angles across the mountain face, directly in front of you. Balanced on the ledge
is a torn black mask.
>x black mask. take it. wear it. s. e. s. d.
It looks like a black paper mask, half life-size. But its curves are only delicate shading; the mask
is flat, a black cutout of a face.
This mask is torn. The left part of the black face, through the eye, has been ripped away. What
remains has a worn expression of irritation -- and perhaps, far below, doubt.
Taken.
Gingerly, you raise the mask to your face....
...Memory stirs...
The one who stands in the field has silver hair, but it is cropped, and faded with streaks of white.
The field has no corn, only muddy ruts.
Behind the tall figure is a city; a bright city, with white spires, but perhaps a cold one. There are
lights within it, but they do not move.
Before the tall figure is an army. Its soldiers are arrayed in mail and gilt tabards. The sign on
their tabards is unrecognizably changed. There are very many of them, and they have come a
very long way, but now they too are still.
The front rank shifts, and three figures come forward. Each carries a tall spear, held upright;
brilliant blue luminosity whirls and knots on each spearpoint. The light falls on the silver-haired
figure, and casts a long red shadow behind him, pointing back at the city.
The three soldiers begin to bring their spears down. The blue radiance flares hungrily.
Then it goes out. The tall figure has raised one hand. No more than that; the spears are
clattering atop each other in the mud, and the three soldiers are on their knees, huddled over
their empty hands.
The gilt ranks shift again, and now it is no ordered movement. Mail-bound faces look up, at the
aching black opacity which has begun to open above the silver one's raised hand. The hurting
blackness is the sky now, and the army begins to run--
...your memory ends abruptly.
You raise your head. You think you can hear voices in the distance.
You move gingerly back to the safety of the catwalk.
Catwalk, North; Night
You stand on a narrow, railless catwalk, which girdles the translucent dome to the south. To the
north, the mountain rises massively above you. But the dome stands on its own promontory; the
mountain face is several yards away. The ravine between dome and mountain is deep and
jagged.
There is a tiny ledge on the face of the mountain.
The copper sail inside the dome is visible here, a dark silhouette. It blocks the firelight; a long
black shadow falls north across the catwalk and out into the empty air.
The distant voices are growing more distinct, if not louder.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving east around the dome.
Catwalk, East; Night
You are at the eastern edge of a catwalk which circles a pale dome. Firelight illuminates the
dome from within. The dome rises from the face of a moonlit mountain peak, which towers to the
north. To the south, the stone slopes fall to a valley, shrouded in night and silence.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving south around the dome.
Catwalk, South; Night
This railless catwalk circles the outer edge of a pale dome, which is illuminated from within. You
stand at the southern edge of the circle; the catwalk disappears around the dome to the east
and west. A few iron steps lead up to an opening in the dome, from which a ladder descends
inside.
The dome is nestled high on the shoulder of a moonlit mountain peak. Below you, a small
terrace is filled with knotted and spiralled garden paths. And far below that, green and dim, a
lush valley spreads away into the night.
The distant voices natter imperiously.
You step up to the opening and climb down into the smoky heat of the dome.
Translucent Dome
You are in a small round dome. The curving surface is translucent, but unlit; the world outside
seems to be dark. The floor beneath your feet is a harsh metal grating. The ladder runs from a
hole in the grating, near the south side, up to a matching opening in the dome above.
A low platform fills the center of the floor. Upon it is a blazing bonfire. Its heat fills the dome, hot
enough to sting on the skin.
A tall triangle of beaten copper rises along the north side of the dome.
[Your score has gone up.]
>d. e. e. n. w. s.
You descend.
Starry Dome, North
You stand at the north edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the south, arching into an
immense dome. The dome is filled with familiar stars.
Among the stars in the northern sky, you see the constellation of the Iron Moth.
A ladder reaches both upwards and downwards from here, passing through openings in the
floor and in the dome's skirt. You can also see a doorway off in the distance, at the far east
edge of the dome.
Starry Dome, East
You stand at the east edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the west, arching into an
immense dome. The dome is filled with familiar stars.
Among the stars in the eastern sky, you see the constellations of Parhu's Galley and Juinua's
Wall.
There is an open archway to the east; beyond it, stairs descend. You can also see a ladder in
the distance, at the north edge of the dome.
You descend the narrow stairs.
Curving Hall, South End
The curving corridor ends here. The blank plaster wall to the south features a large window;
outside, stars gleam in a night sky. You can go through the archway to the east, take the stairs
which ascend to the west, or return north along the corridor.
You abruptly hear the sound of harp music, although you can see no source.
Curving Hall
You are in a high, dim corridor, walled in cracked and moldering plaster. The only light comes
from tiny flickering candles above. The hall curves gently around from the south to the
northwest. You see an open door to the west; archways open to the northeast and east.
Sitting Room
This room seems more inviting. The walls are painted with delicate patterns of flowers, which
merge into a soft-hued carpet beneath your feet. Two chairs and a cushioned settee face a
bright-flickering fireplace on the far wall.
You see an empty hook above the fireplace.
You see doorways to the south and in the southeast corner of the room. A white-painted door to
the east is open.
The distant voices continue to murmur.
Crowded Study
You stand amid clutter, oddments, shelves and stacks. The chamber is comfortably broad,
centered around a massive and well-worn wooden desk. But so much is jammed in, around the
desk and up the panelled walls, that you barely find room to stand. Books; papers; dried plants;
animals stuffed and preserved, antique instruments, candles of any hue. You don't recognize
half of it, and you can't name half the rest.
There are wide doorways on the north and east sides of the room. A door of heavy wood stands
closed to the south, and stairs descend into dimness to the west.
You see an immense book on the desk. Behind the desk is a tall glass-fronted cabinet. Beside
that is a small brass trunk, which is open but empty.
>unlock door with iron key. s.
The iron key unlocks the door. You turn the knob and swing it open.
Iron Corridor
This hall is a windowless square tube of dark hammered iron, stretching south. Yellow light
trembles in a hanging sconce above you; and another ahead, and another, and on. But you
cannot see far. The sconces darken and fade in the near distance. You cannot even see the
door behind you.
>x walls. x sconces. s. n. n.
The walls look like wrought iron -- exactly like the floor and ceiling.
Directly above you a plain iron bowl hangs from a chain. You cannot see the contents, but an
unsteady yellow light reflects silently from the ceiling. More sconces hang along the corridor,
every few feet to the south and north.

Curtained Room
The walls of this small room are entirely swathed in heavy brocade curtains. The only openings
are to the west and northwest, and a closed lead-slab door to the south.
In the center of the room is a massive, high-backed chair of some pale wood. Directly before it is
a tall mirror in a standing frame.
As you cross the room's threshold, the voices go silent -- a sudden and simultaneous hush, as
of exultant expectation.
> sit. x mirror.
I didn't understand that sentence.
> sit x mirror.
I didn't understand that sentence.
>sit
(on top of the chair)
You sit down in the chair, facing the mirror.
> x mirror.
You blink and stare into the mirror. How odd.
The mirror reflects your chair, and the curtains behind you, perfectly. But your own form is
unclear -- as if the mirror were touched with some distorting oil. The blurring is strongest around
your upper body; your head appears to be a faceless blank.
Nervously, you raise your hand to your own face. Everything feels in its place. But your
reflection has raised a blurred hand to a featureless void.
And dim black, red, green, blue, gold, brown, and white shadows seem to flit around your
reflected body. Then they are gone.
>put white mask on mirror. put gold mask on mirror. put red mask on mirror.
You hold the white mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the mask is
no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror. Or is it now worn by your
reflection?
You know this: When you sneak out at night to gaze up at the stars, you can hear them laugh
and tell each other stories. Cannot everyone?
You hold the gold mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the mask is
no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror.
You know this: Life takes its own course, and sometimes no reason nor argument nor urgent
need can divert its speaking tide.
You hold the red mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the mask is
no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror.
You know this: The incidents are not the essence, and the blood is not the life. But the incidents
of blood are a symbol beneath every human thought.
>put brown mask on mirror. put green mask on mirror. put blue mask on mirror.
You hold the brown mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the mask
is no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror.
You know this: Mathematic art may chart the course of a messenger, or an army, more precisely
than a knotted string on a peg-nailed map. But the simple string is an art which can be seen and
felt. Thus does the general see and feel.
You hold the green mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the mask
is no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror.
You know this: To win a battle is never a gain. It only means you may resume the burdens you
bore before the war. You do not look forward to them.
You hold the blue mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the mask is
no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror.
You know this: The dance of symbols is the movement of the people. Perhaps you have not
studied them enough... but your own studies, the symbols of worlds within and above, press you
so.
>put black mask on mirror. x mirror. stand. w.
You hold the torn black mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the
mask is no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror.
You know this: These people interrupt your studies--
And your mind, splintered and cleaved as it is, begins to draw together. The masks -- yes!
elements of yourself; you see the structure! -- seek reabsorption. It will be slow, but unceasing.
Your reflection is a patchwork -- fragments orbiting lazily above the chair. You nonetheless feel
sure that one is missing.
You stand up from the chair, as layers of memory shift like waves within you.
One layer is still broken and half-blind. The missing fragment of the seventh. What part of you....
Crowded Study
You stand amid clutter, oddments, shelves and stacks. The chamber is comfortably broad,
centered around a massive and well-worn wooden desk. But so much is jammed in, around the
desk and up the panelled walls, that you barely find room to stand. Books; papers; dried plants;
animals stuffed and preserved, antique instruments, candles of any hue. You can't remember
where half of it came from.
There are wide doorways on the north and east sides of the room. The heavy wooden door to
your laboratory stands open to the south, and stairs descend into dimness to the west.
You see an immense book on the desk. Behind the desk is a tall glass-fronted cabinet. Beside
that is a small brass trunk, which is open but empty.
"You tear the borders of nations!" comes the angry shout. "No. You are the nail, obdurate from
an ancient age, upon which nations snag and tear themselves. No thought has passed in the
civilized world for an dozen centuries which did not scrape upon your presence!"
"So?" you reply. "Then soon you shall have peace. I shall tear open the borders of the world. I
shall take the step outside."
And your eye snags again upon the book, the heart of this place, in which you have nearly done
that work.
>x book. s.
The book lies open to the critical page:
 The Theory & UNDERSTANDING of Portalls;
The lesser, which make a single place of many, and the Greater, which open from NOW into
Time in Memory, or Prophecy Foretold, or even a Moment's Fancy;
All portals are perilous. Perilous thresholds to cross, and more perilous to create; For there is no
plying of the World, or of Time, that does not happen in the Mind of the learned one who
conceives of the journey. Of your Thought is the portal built, arch and capstone. Slip but a
moment of your attention, and the Portal will fall into ruin; All its might, and yours, crumbled into
eggshell fragments that stray upon the Wind; ...
The facing page shows an elaborate circular diagram, annotated here and there with tiny
mathematical notes. This is the culminating step of your long work. You are sure, in the
yet-fogged halls of your memory, that every other preparation is complete. You recall writing the
comment in the margin: "Best to draw in a well-insulated space -- 35 Ll. of uncut stone? -- move
house to Emmen Valley, work into mountain?"
You have no recollection of the labor that must have followed. But it will come; and there is no
reason to delay turning initial failure into triumph. The door to your laboratory is before you, and
the privacy spell can no longer confound you.
Iron Corridor
This hall is a windowless square tube of dark hammered iron, stretching north. Yellow light
trembles in a hanging sconce above you.
Ahead, the air is mirrored with the privacy spell you left in place. The lamp is reflected in it,
again and again, into the seeming distance.
>x spell. break it.
The spell hovers to the south, mindlessly awaiting the approach of some uncrafty explorer. It
isn't even smart enough to recognize you, although you could smash it with a thought.
You reach into the spell, grasp a strand of the thought you bound into it, and snap. The spell
unweaves neatly.
"The work was well enough, for an offhand guard spell." You shrug off the reflexive criticism. Far
more interesting work awaits.
Iron Passage
You are in a short connecting passage, walled in hammered iron. A heavy wooden door stands
to the north; to the south is a large chamber. A single sconce hangs above your head.
>s
Laboratory
You stand in a chamber built of massive squared stones. The only exit is a plain doorway in the
north wall. Shelves line the east side of the room; the opposite wall is painted with an elaborate
mural. Between them, a worktable -- a single heavy granite slab, cluttered with the tools of your
work.
In the center of the worktable is a complex apparatus of mirrors and lenses. The table also
contains an empty flask, a wooden basket, a leaden jar, and a scrap of paper.
>x mural. x shelves. x table. look under table. x drain. x flagstones.
(the mural)
The mural is stylized but finely detailed. You wonder once again at its origin... it was here when
you built the room. Such things are inevitable in a house such as yours. But you still wonder.
The angular figure is painted against a red sky -- dawn or dusk, you've never been sure. It
strides confidently forward, towards some unknown destination. The figure wears a black cloak,
and a heavy gauntlet which might be leather. Slung on one shoulder is a small, decorative
shield; the other arm bears a dark bracer or wristlet. The figure holds a black dagger
outstretched in its gauntlet. The other hand holds high an intricately knotted thread; and the
figure's eyes are fixed upon this, as if upon a map or the key to a riddle.
You need nothing from the shelves right now; and so they are obligingly empty.
The granite table is several inches thick; it rests on immovable boulders. The work space is
dominated by a complex optical apparatus. Also on the table are an empty flask, a wooden
basket, a leaden jar, and a scrap of paper.
The table is supported by four irregular outcrops of granite, which rise through the floor to
precisely equal height. Between them, a small drain opens between the slate flagstones.
You see a small hole in the floor, beneath the worktable. The rim is slightly stained from all the
various concoctions and alchemic mistakes you've poured down it.
Broad flagstones of black slate pave the chamber. They are laid not quite flat; the floor slopes
down, very slightly, to a drain under the worktable.
>x apparatus. x chain. x flask. take it.
An intertwined bloom of struts supports shining lenses and mirrors, all held in precise positions.
An oval loop of wire projects out from a niche in the arrangement. The oval loop is empty. Next
to the loop hangs a gold pull-chain.
A short chain of fine golden links dangles from within the optical apparatus. A small knob on the
end invites you to tug.
The flask is a small hollow oval of glass, no bigger than a teacup. It is empty.
Taken.
>x basket. x resin. take it.
Standing on the table is a rough wooden basket. It is at least two feet tall, and broad and heavy
to match. The basket is full of lumps of golden resin.
The basket is full of lumps of golden resin.
You choose a lump from the basket.
>x jar. x dust. smell dust. taste dust. take jar.
It's a cylindrical jar of grey lead, with a narrow pouring-spout. You can see a stock of glittering
blue dust inside.
Within the jar is a stock of extraordinarily fine, deep-blue dust. The powder has a faintly
crystalline gleam to it.
The blue dust has no odor.
You dust a few deep-blue grains onto your tongue. The powder dissolves instantly, washing a
warm, clear salt-tang through you. It spreads across your palate and the back of your throat,
though you have not consciously swallowed; it burns faintly, and is gone.
Taken.
>x scrap.
You have the formulation of the necessary ink scrawled here: "Winter lithontree resin, and
sea-blood corundum -- combine -- ensolve by exposure to (2 pulses) month-aged noonlight."
Easy enough to repeat. The hard part was gathering those substances.
>put resin in flask. pour dust in flask.
(the lump of resin in the empty flask)
The lump of resin plunks into the flask.
You carefully pour blue dust onto the lump of resin in the flask, until it is full.
>>put flask in loop. pull chain. g. x ink. take flask.
That's not a verb I recognize.
>>put flask in loop
That's not a verb I recognize.
>put flask in loop. pull chain. g. x ink. take flask.
The flask fits neatly into the heart of the apparatus.
You pull the chain, and the flask swings up into the apparatus. After a moment of blinding
refractions, it swings back down. The lump of resin is visibly swelling, even as the light fades;
the blue dust is being absorbed within. In moments, the mixture is a homogenous brown gel.
You pull the chain, and the flask swings up into the apparatus. After a moment of blinding
refractions, it swings back down. The gel has liquified into a beautiful velvet-black ink.
The ink shifts slowly in the flask, reflecting only a bare edge of light. This, indeed, is the
substance you used in your last attempt.
You pluck the flask from the optical apparatus.
>put jar on table.
You put the leaden jar on the table.
>put orange berry in drain. put white berry in drain.
You drop an orange berry into the drain. It vanishes with an imperceptible hiss.
You drop a white berry into the drain. It vanishes with an unnerving rumble. Maybe that disposal
effect isn't perfect after all.

your laboratory stands open to the south, and stairs descend into dimness to the west.
You see a torn black shred and an immense book on the desk. Behind the desk is a tall
glass-fronted cabinet. Beside that is a small brass trunk, which is open but empty.
>x shred. take it. wear it. x diagram
It's the left side of a face, sketched on black paper. It seems to have been torn from a drawing of
you.
Wait. Was that there before?
Taken.
You hold the black shred up before your left eye.
-- too late, for your bitter wrath is descending--
You yank it away, shivering. Could that have been you?
The diagram takes up an entire page of the immense book. The whole is inscribed in a circle;
but it has countless partitions, spirals, and inner elaborations.
You glare at the diagram in irritation. You have spent months studying it. You could redraw it
perfectly if you were blindfolded, drunk, and singing bawdy Morovnan sea ballads. What could
have gone wrong?

You hold the torn black shred up against the mirror, over the reflection of your eye.
And then it is gone, and your reflection is complete.
--the mail-clad mob swirled, and turned, and began to run. Of course it was too late. You
watched their life force separate into strands... still swirling. Interesting. You regarded the scene
until the last tendrils dissipated. There had been a pattern to it, beyond the overlay of animal
pain and terror.
You returned to your cityworld, considering a possible theorem. Further interruptions would be
unlikely, for at least a generation, and you needed the time to think.
And you have made good use of that time. The mistake in your portal diagram is obvious in
retrospect. A thousand worlds await beyond that threshold; and you plan to make use of them
all.

This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine
paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead
down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.
You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red
battery and a tourist map) here.
As you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto
the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down
some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with
plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves
and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing
cupboard to the south is cluttered.
An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic
noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase
leads up and to the east into the attic.
Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

Potting Room
This light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which
extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well
considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's
no electric light.
A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns
from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden

East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over
from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof

Roof
This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below. There used to
be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk
leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it
especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south.

Battlements
The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, his castle,
but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-looking features were just a
seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way
to proceed is back southeast.

An iron, gothic-looking key catches your eye.

never venture into the attic again.

 Uh oh. There lots of tree near farm, too. Fire get there before Grunk. Farm burn like tree. Grunk think that maybe boss not say Grunk do good job, if boss find out that Grunk make fire. Maybe it better if Grunk not go back to farm after all.

 Pie cut up into more than seven piece, and every piece have different color. Purple piece at top. To right of purple piece there orange piece, then there white piece at right side, then there red piece, and then yellow piece at bottom.

 Statue look like little man with round nose and big ear and moustache. Grunk think funny little man maybe called “gnome”. Wear funny suit and pointy shoe and little round hat. One hand point north, at wall. Other hand up in air.

 Gnome stand on big stone block. Maybe block for making gnome look tall. It true that statue look more big than real gnome, but Grunk think that just because it statue. Maybe all thing look more big when it like rock.

 “That orb is a good example of mossfuressence,” him say, “Just like the glowing walls in the main shrine. I had it equipped with magic words for turning it on and off.”

 Gnome show ball to Grunk. It all blue and glowy. Then him put it back on shelf.

 All the story that Grunk hear about hero end with “and then orc killed hero hooray.” Grunk think that maybe not same kind of story.

 This is a story by Grunk. It’s about something that happened to him before he joined the army. We’re not quite sure how much of it is true, and how much is just a product of his imagination. We suspect Grunk may not be sure either.

 It should be impossible to get the story into an unwinnable state. It is possible to end it prematurely, but you should always be able to safely UNDO.

 Lost Pig was written as an entry for the 2007 Interactive Fiction Competition.

 [SPACE.]

 Conversation in this game is topic-based. You can ASK, TELL, or TALK TO characters about different things Grunk has seen or heard about during the course of the story. For your typing convenience, any of these three commands can be shortened to T <TOPIC>, provided Grunk knows whom he should be addressing his concerns to at the moment.

 When you’re returning to a place you’ve visited before, you can use the GO TO command to attempt to go there directly. Likewise, this can also be used to locate characters who are currently in places you’re already familiar with.

 [SPACE.]

 Everyone has their own preferences, but sometimes it can be more fun and more satisfying to solve a puzzle on your own without outside help. Are you sure you want to look at the hints right now?

 After gnome and Grunk both wait for little bit, gnome say. “It’s a big ambition. My first model is only able to perform simple arithmetic.

 Shelf Room
 There lots of shelfs in this room. Them on every wall. This room probably have lots and lots of thing in it before. But shelfs all empty now. Grunk not see any thing there at all. Doorway to northwest go back to bright room. Other doorway go west.

 There open stone chest at back of room.

 Grunk see half brick here too.

 Gnome Room
 This look like room for little person. It have bed that too little for Grunk. It have trunk that too little for Grunk. It have desk that too little for Grunk. Desk have stool that too little for Grunk. Room have doorway to east and west too, but them not so little. That good, because if doorway too little for Grunk, not know how Grunk get back out of room.

 Gnome here looking at book.

 On top of shelf there torch (on fire).

 On top of desk there book.

 Grunk see coin here too.

 Pig squeal loud!

 Gnome put finger up to mouth. “Shh,” him say to pig, “I’m reading.”

 Pig squeal quiet.

 >give chair to gnome
 Gnome smile. “Thanks,” him say, “But the torch you gave me will do just fine.”

 Gnome give chair back to Grunk.

 Gnome not even look when Grunk go.

 Fountain Room
 All wall in this room glow. It bright, just like day time. Except that instead of sun, it wall that glow. And instead of grass and tree, it square room with four wall. And instead of outside, it all under ground. But beside those thing, it just like it! Tunnel keep going out to east and west, but normal doorway go north and southeast and southwest.

 In middle of room, there fountain. But fountain not have any water.

 South wall have big curtain hanging on it.

 >n

 Statue Room
 This room have two big picture that face each other. West wall have picture on it and and east wall have different picture on it. Grunk think both picture really just part of wall, though. South wall have doorway in it and north wall not have anything in it.

 Statue of little man stand here, up on big stone block.

 Pig look at picture on one wall. Then pig look at picture on other wall.

 >give chair to statue
 OK, Grunk put chair into statue hand.

 Grunk hear loud noise like rock dragging on rock. Then part of north wall open up!

 [Grunk score go up one.]

 >n

 Windy Cave
 Wow, this just like real cave! It have big pointy rock that stick down from up high, and it have big pointy rock that stick up from ground, and it even have dark and twisty tunnel that go north!

 There lots of wind that come from north. Must be tunnel that go to other place. Wind smell like fresh air, so maybe tunnel go outside.

 Secret door in south wall not look so secret from here. Door still open right now.

 >n
 When Grunk go into windy tunnel, wind blow hard. But Grunk make own light now.

 Twisty Cave
 There tunnel here that go all different way. It all very twisty and confusing. Not even sure what way Grunk come from.

 >blow whistle
 Tweeeeeeeeeeee!

 Gnome wander in from side tunnel.

 “There you are, Grunk,” gnome say. “I had a suspicion you might get lost here, so I thought I’d better check in on you.”

 Gnome not wearing stripe dress and slipper anymore. Now him wearing blue suit with jacket and pointy shoe and two little strap for keeping pants up. Think maybe Grunk see suit like that before some place, but not remember for sure. Gnome dragging trunk behind him, too.

 Gnome walk over to Grunk. Give trunk to Grunk. Think that means carrying it Grunk job now.

 “It was a good idea to use the whistle. It certainly made finding you easier.” Gnome start walking toward tunnel that Grunk not try yet. Him look back and say, “Well, c’mon. I’ll show you the way out.”

 Gnome go southeast.

 >
 Huh?

 >se

 Probably New Tunnel
 This really tricky place. It all twisty and dark. Think even pig confused.

 Gnome here, waiting for Grunk.

 “I’ve decided it’s time to quit being a hermit,” gnome say. “I suppose in some way, you’re responsible for that. Even if you didn’t quite leave everything in perfect condition, you still helped me out.” Gnome stop and think. Grunk think gnome thinking about what way to go. Then gnome look back at Grunk and say, “So, thanks.”

 Gnome climb down into hole in ground.

 >down

 Some Other Cave
 There still lots of different tunnel here that go every way Grunk can see. Not really know where Grunk at, but Grunk think gnome know, and that good enough for Grunk.

 Gnome here, waiting for Grunk.

 Gnome say to Grunk, “It’s been too long since I’ve done anything that really mattered. But I’ve got some new ideas, and I think they could be big. Bigger than mossfuressence, even.”

 Gnome look left and right. “Come on, we’re going this way,” him say. Then him duck into little tunnel that go south. Walking around in tunnel seem so easy for gnome. Him even talking at same time and still not get lost at all.

 >s

 Forest
 Hey, Grunk outside again! Yay! It still night time, but Grunk have light, so that OK. This look like it near place Grunk at before. Farm not far at all from here. Just little way to southwest.

 Gnome here, waiting for Grunk.

 Gnome take trunk back from Grunk. “I think this is where we part ways,” him say. “You can probably find your way back to the farm from here.” Gnome shake Grunk hand. Then gnome say, “Remember the name Zugilbor Galrogginpots sem Endali dec Frebensalbibit. This won’t be the last time you hear it.”

 Then gnome go one way and Grunk go other way. It not long before Grunk back at farm. Boss already sleeping, so Grunk put pig back quiet and go to bed. Tomorrow, maybe boss proud of Grunk.

     *** Grunk bring pig back to farm ***

 >talk to hacker
 Hmmm … the hacker waits for you to say something.

 >hacker, hi
 “Greetingage.” He turns back to his hacking.

 >ask hacker about hacking
 I don’t know the word “hacking.”

 >examine pc
 This is a beyond-state-of-the-art personal computer. It has a 1024 by 1024 pixel color monitor, a mouse, an attached hard disk, and a local area network connection. Fortunately, one of its features is a prominent HELP key. It is currently turned off.

 >turn on pc
 The computer powers up, goes through a remarkably fast self-check, and greets you, requesting “LOGIN PLEASE:”. The only sound you hear is a very low hum.

 >login
 What do you want to login?

 >log in to computer
 I don’t know the word “log.”

 >type username
 The computer responds “PASSWORD PLEASE:”

 >type password
 What do you want to type passwo?

 >ask hacker about password
 There seems to be a noun missing in that sentence.

 >type 872325412
 The computer responds “INVALID LOGIN” and then “LOGIN PLEASE:”.

 >type 872325412
 The computer responds “PASSWORD PLEASE:”

 >type uhlersoth
 The computer responds “Good evening. You’re here awfully late.” It displays a list of pending tasks, one of which is in blinking red letters, with large arrows pointing to it. The task reads “Classics Paper,” some particularly ominous words next to it say “DUE TOMORROW!” and more reassuringly, a menu box next to that reads “Edit Classics Paper.”

 >edit classics paper
 The menu box is replaced by the YAK text editor and menu boxes listing the titles of your files. The one for your paper is highlighted in a rather urgent-looking shade of red.

 >press help key
 You push the friendly-looking HELP key. A spritely little box appears on the screen, which reads: “Please click the box representing the file you wish to edit or view. I notice that one file is marked as urgent, so you should probably click its box.”

 >click urgent box
 You click the box for your paper, and the box grows reassuringly until it fills most of the screen. Unfortunately, the text that fills it bears no resemblance to your paper. The title is the same, but after that, there is something different, very different.

 >read paper
 The paper appears to be a facsimile overlaid with occasional typescript. The text is mostly in a sort of “Olde English” you’ve never seen before. What you read is a combination of incomprehensible gibberish, latinate pseudowords, debased Hebrew and Arabic scripts, and an occasional disquieting phrase in English.

 As you look at it more closely, you find it hard to focus on the screen, but impossible to look away. Your finger strays toward the “MORE” box…

 >save
 Okay.

 >press more
 You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.

 The second page is much like the first, but around the edges, not when you look at it straight, it’s almost readable. There is something about a “summoning,” or a “visitor.”

 >summon visitor
 I don’t know the word “summon.”

 >press more
 You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.

 The third page is in the same script as the first, but laid out like a poem. There are woodcut illustrations which are queasily disturbing.

 There is a translation, or notes for one, typed between the lines of the poem:

 “He returns, he is called back (?)
 The loyal ones (acolytes?) make a sacrifice
 Those who survive will meet him (be absorbed? eaten?)
 They will live, yet die
 Forever will be (is?) nothing to them (to him?)

 “His place (lair? burrow?) must be prepared
 His food (offerings?) must be prepared
 Call him forth (invite him?) with great power
 Only an acceptable (tasteful?) sacrifice will call him forth
 He will be grateful (satiated?)”

 The rest is even more fragmentary.

 >press more
 You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.

 The fourth page is a photograph. You try to recoil from the screen, but cannot. Fascinated and repelled at the same time, you wonder: is that a mouth, and what is in it?

 >examine photograph
 I don’t know the word “photograph.”

 >x photo
 I don’t know the word “photo.”

 >x page
 Instead, you find your finger moving towards the MORE box, and you touch it. The screen feels oddly cold.

 You faint, and when you awaken…

 [Use $SOUND to toggle sound usage on and off.]

 Place
 This is a place. Things move about on a broken, rocky surface. Harsh sounds split the air. Something sticky grabs at your feet. There is no color, everything is drained of brightness, dull and lifeless. A path descends into a shallow bowl of black basalt.

 >d
 Basalt Bowl
 You are at the bottom of a deeply cut, smooth basalt bowl. Dimly seen shapes crowd you on all sides. Ahead, in the focus of the movement, is a rock platform.

 >forward
 I don’t know the word “forward.”

 >x shapes
 I don’t know the word “shapes.”

 >x platform
 The platform is made of the same rocks as the surrounding terrain. In fact, you can’t tell whether it is natural or constructed.

 The crowd around you begins to sway and groan. They are expecting something. You are drawn forward by the noise.

 At Platform
 You stand before a low rock platform, more like an afterthought of piled rocks or a glacial moraine than a work of artifice. You are pushed against the pile by the crowd around you.

 One small stone stands out in the pile, smooth, shiny, and glowing with a blazing light.

 >x stone
 It’s a smooth, shiny piece of what might be obsidian. Scratched on it is a symbol.

 >x symbol
 The symbol, on close examination, appears to have been carved into the smooth stone, perhaps with a claw. The symbol is like nothing you’ve ever seen, and yet somehow you know it has meaning.

 >take stone
 Taken.

 Suddenly, the dimness becomes darkness, and the crowd around you explodes with excitement. You are jostled and shoved from all sides. A low keening begins, building into a deafening, almost mechanical chant. The darkness before you compacts and deepens.

 >eat stone
 The food here is terrible, but this is ridiculous!

 The darkness before you, now visible, is a creature. It towers over the now-silent crowd. The thing jerks this way and that, spraying a foul ichor. Its palps twitch expectantly, then pound impatiently against the rock. You can feel the smooth stone vibrating in your hand.

 >show stone to creature
 The thing is uninterested.

 The thing now turns, sensing the presence of the stone. It quests almost blindly for it, then those surrounding you thrust you forward. The thing stoops, its mandibles grasping you. You are lifted towards its gaping maw. The stench and the sounds issuing from it are overwhelming, and you fall unconscious.

 You are awakened by the thump of your head hitting the terminal in front of you. Falling asleep over term papers! It must have been a nightmare. Embarrassed, you glance around. Yes, the hacker is looking in your direction. He must have heard the thump.

 Terminal Room, on the chair

 A really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.

 Sitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.

 >i
 You are carrying a smooth stone and an assignment.

 The hacker wanders over, trying to look nonchalant as he takes over your chair. “Losing, huh?” he asks wittily. He glances at your terminal, which displays a pattern of snow and unusual characters. He appears somewhat excited.

 >x terminal
 This is a beyond-state-of-the-art personal computer. It has a 1024 by 1024 pixel color monitor, a mouse, an attached hard disk, and a local area network connection. Fortunately, one of its features is a prominent HELP key. On the screen you see a menu box.

 The hacker, mumbling under his breath, begins a flurry of activity. First the screen returns to something nearly normal, then windows begin popping up like toadstools after a rain. The screen looks a lot like the top of his terminal table (or the bottom of a trash can).

 >read assignment
 Laser printed on creamy bond paper, the assignment is due tomorrow. It’s from your freshman course in “The Classics in the Modern Idiom,” better known as “21.014.” It reads, in part: “Twenty pages on modern analogues of Xenophon’s ‘Anabasis.'” You’re not sure whether this refers to the movie “The Warriors” or “Alien,” but this is the last assignment you need to complete in this course this term. You wonder, yet again, why a technical school requires you to endure this sort of stuff.

 The hacker types furiously, and the screen displays what to you looks like an explosion in a teletype factory. After a while he says. “Chomping file system. Your directory has gone seriously west. I fixed it.” He checks the screen. “It was mixed up on the file server with some files from the Department of Alchemy.” He grunts. “People’s names for their nodes are getting weird. This one is called ‘Lovecraft.'” He pauses. “Your paper is gone, though. Sorry. Maybe they could help you down there.”

 >cry
 I don’t know the word “cry.”

 >x hacker
 The hacker is sitting at your terminal, typing furiously. Every so often, he pauses briefly and twirls a lock of his hair. He is also humming under his breath. The hacker is dressed in blue jeans, an old work shirt, and what might once have been running shoes. Hanging from his belt is an enormous ring of keys. He is in need of a bath.

 The hacker wanders back to his terminal and returns to his hacking.

 >show stone to hacker
 “Odd-looking thing. Are you a rock-jock?”

 >take keys
 “Hey! No snarfage, loser!” You determine that this means, “Stop!”

 >ask hacker about keys
 “I’ve accumulated a few keys over the years. I’m a licensed locksmith, which helps. I can get into any room at Tech.” He pulls the keyring out on its chain, and shows off a key you hadn’t noticed before. “This is a master key,” he says.

 >ask hacker for master key
 “Fat chance! This is a master key! What have you done for me lately?”

 >save
 Okay.

 >punch hacker
 I don’t know the word “punch.”

 >ask hacker about department of alchemy
 You can’t see any department of alchemy here.

 The hacker turns to you and says, “I don’t know where I can get something to eat, what with all the snow.”

 >feed hacker
 (to the hacker)
 You aren’t holding the hacker.

 >feed assignment to hacker
 “No thanks, keep it for now.”

 >l
 Terminal Room
 This is a large room crammed with computer terminals, small computers, and printers. An exit leads south. Banners, posters, and signs festoon the walls. Most of the tables are covered with waste paper, old pizza boxes, and empty Coke cans. There are usually a lot of people here, but tonight it’s almost deserted.

 Nearby is one of those ugly molded plastic chairs.

 A really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.

 Sitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.

 The hacker turns to you and says, “I’d hate to leave, with the machines so empty. On the other hand, I’m seriously starving.”

 Renovated Cave
 You are in a huge, cave-like construction. A path leads down to a floor partly covered with rough concrete. The walls and ceiling are high and reinforced with beams of wood, iron, and steel.

 Before the Altar
 You are at the bottom of the cave. The huge slab of granite in the center is a sort of altar. It is carved with strange and disturbing symbols, the largest of which looks very familiar. Some of the symbols are obscured by rusty red stains. Nearby is an iron plate set in the concrete of the floor.

 Lying to one side of the altar stone is a sharp, thin-bladed knife.

 This dank and grimy tunnel is largely filled with an imperfectly insulated steam pipe. The tunnel is uncomfortably hot and damp. A bundle of coaxial cable runs along the ceiling, festooned with damp mold and cobwebs. The tunnel continues west.

 The tunnel continues west from here, becoming narrow, muddy, and forbidding. The walls no longer seem to be as finished as they were. The steam pipe and coaxial cable disappear into the ceiling at this point. The temperature has dropped considerably, as well.

 The tunnel you came through continues down, barely large enough to enter. It is made of sticky gelatinous mud that’s been pushed by something into a semblance of a passage.

 >d
 Large Chamber
 This is a wide spot in the tunnel, just as wet and muddy as elsewhere. The walls are slimy as well. Numerous slots or indentations about two feet wide and a foot high open here and there. Thin, wire or ropelike growths emerge from a hole further down and enter each of the slots. There is background noise here, almost loud enough to hear clearly.

 A small, furtive motion attracts your attention to the slots.

 >x slots
 The slots are narrow burrows apparently dug by hand out of the mud of the chamber walls. Most of the slots have a thin wire or rope heading into them. You begin to be quite certain that there is something moving inside the slot you are looking at.

 There is motion in the slots. In fact, there is motion in almost all of them.

 >listen
 The noise, as you listen more carefully, resolves itself into voices. They are chanting, but the words are unknown to you.

 Slowly, painfully, things emerge from the slots. They are pale, thin creatures with red mouths and staring eyes. Mold grows in their hair and wirelike streamers wrap their heads and join a bundle on the floor. You realize that these are urchins.

 >cut wire with knife
 The knife drives the wire into the mud, but doesn’t cut it.

 >x urchins
 These are not normal looking urchins. Their clothes are muddy and tattered. They are barefoot in midwinter, and covered with mud. Around their heads are draped the ropy growths that you’ve been noticing in this area. Although their eyes are open, they stare catatonically.

 >enter slot
 You squeeze your way into one of the slots. The mud coats you with a cold, slimy coat which makes it barely possible to breathe. You slide out with all the speed you can muster.

 This is a tiny, narrow, ill-fitting room. It appears to have been a left over space from the joining of two preexisting buildings. It is roughly coffin shaped. The walls are covered by decades of overlaid graffiti, but there is one which is painted in huge fluorescent letters that were apparently impossible for later artists to completely deface. On the floor is a rusty access hatch which is open.

 Department of Alchemy
 This office is clinically clean, shiny, and modern. It looks like something out of a science fiction movie. A closed door to the north leads back into the corridor and an archway opens to the south.

 This is the lobby of the Brown Building, an eighteen-story skyscraper which houses the Meteorology Department and other outposts of the Earth Sciences. The elevator is out of order, but a long stairway leads up to the roof, and another leads down to the basement. A revolving door leads out into the night.

 >out
 You enter the freezing, biting cold of the blizzard.

 Small Courtyard
 This courtyard is a triumph of modern architecture. It is spare, cold, angular, overwhelming in size, and bears a striking resemblance to a wind tunnel whenever the breeze picks up. Right now this is true of the whole campus, though. A huge mass lurks nearby, and an almost featureless skyscraper is to the north.

 You are beginning to tire.

 >drink coke
 The bottle is empty.

 Bitter, bone-cracking cold assaults you continuously. The temperature and the blizzard conditions are both horrible.

 Infinite Corridor
 The so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus building. The corridor extends both ways from here. A stairway leads up, and a door leads out to the Great Court.

 The floor here is covered with slippery, messy floor wax.

 There is a wall socket on one wall, and a heavy-duty power cord is plugged into it. The cord terminates in a severed stump.

 There is a fire axe here.

 There is a largish machine down the hall to the east.

 >take ax

 >up
 You slip and slide on the wax. It’s like walking on wet ice. You can barely keep upright, but you manage to lose your balance in just the right way to keep going.

 Great Dome
 Here a walkway circles the base of a huge ornate dome. Below is the Infinite Corridor. From stories of Tech Exploring trips, you recall that there is supposed to be a ladder here. On the other hand, there is a shiny rope-like thing hanging near where the ladder used to be, and leading upward.

 >x rope
 The strand is wet and glistening. It extends upward into the dome, leading to a narrow catwalk.

 >up
 There is no stairway.

 >climb rope
 The wet stuff on the strand sticks to the gloves, but doesn’t otherwise affect you. You have a little trouble climbing up to the catwalk, but grab the rail just before your strength gives out. You heave yourself up onto the catwalk.

 You stand up on the catwalk, catching your breath for a moment. Your eyes stray along the strand you climbed. It trails along the catwalk, where it joins something large and squishy squatting at the far side. A single, bright-blue eye opens in the squishy mass, and the tentacle (for that’s what it is) retracts. The mass almost flows through the spaces in the catwalk railing and drops to the floor fifteen feet below. Before you can react, it’s gone.

 Top of Dome
 Inside the great dome, near the top, a metal catwalk is precariously perched. There is no way further up, but a small metal door is set in the side of the dome.

 Where the pulpy mass was squatting, a wooden ladder lies on the catwalk.

 >lower ladder
 You lower the ladder to the walkway below. It’s just the right length to climb down.

 >open door
 You open the door, and freezing air, blowing snow, and howling wind enter and whip around you.

 >out
 You enter the freezing, biting cold of the blizzard.

 Roof of Great Dome
 You are perched precariously on the roof of the Great Dome. A set of narrow indentations in the dome provides a dangerous route to the very tip-top of the dome.

 >save
 Okay.

 >up
 You scramble up icy surface of the dome, almost slipping a few times, but finally you make it to the top.

 On the Great Dome
 This is the very top of the Great Dome, a favorite place for Tech fraternities to install cows, Volkswagen Beetles, giant birthday candles, and other bizarre objects. The top is flat, round, and about five feet in diameter. It’s very windy, which has kept the snow from accumulating here. The only way off is down.

 In the exact center of the flat area is a bronze plug.

 Bitter, bone-cracking cold assaults you continuously. The temperature and the blizzard conditions are both horrible.

 >x plug
 This is a cylindrical bronze plug about two inches in diameter. It is set in the center of the flat part of the dome.

 >take plug
 You pry the plug out of its socket, revealing a cylindrical hole about the same diameter but somewhat deeper. There is a piece of paper in the hole.

 >get paper
 Taken.

 You are feeling tired.

 >read it
 You unroll the piece of paper and read the shaky handwriting:

 “I can no longer face what I’ve been doing. I can’t sleep, I start at the slightest noise, and even dulling my senses with alcohol or drugs is no longer enough. I refuse to participate in what he is doing any more. Either he is insane, or I am insane, or (and this is what I fear most) the universe itself is insane. I have only one final warning: I am the only suicide, but I will not be the final death.”

 The name signed to it is that of the Alchemy Department graduate student.

 You can feel the cold worming its way through your layers of clothing and biting into your flesh.

 This corridor is lined with closed, dark offices. At the south end of the corridor is a door with a light shining behind it. There is something written on the door.

 You knock on the door. The hollow sound reverberates down the hall. You sort of wish you had knocked more softly.

 >open door
 It’s locked.

 >knock softly
 I don’t know the word “softly.”

 >unlock door with key
 The key fits perfectly in the lock, but the lock doesn’t turn. The master key doesn’t work on this lock.

 The door opens partway, revealing a professorial man in a white lab coat. He smiles. “Back for another visit, are you?” He ushers you into the room without waiting for an answer, closing the door behind you.

 Department of Alchemy
 This office is clinically clean, shiny, and modern. It looks like something out of a science fiction movie. A closed door to the north leads back into the corridor and an archway opens to the south.

 Taped to the wall to the right of the archway is a sign-up sheet.

 The professor is here.

 >show note to professor
 He reads it carefully. “What drivel! This just confirms my suspicions. He had clearly gone over the edge. Drug use, drinking, insanity. It’s only too bad that I didn’t realize what was happening. I might have helped him.”

 The professor continues to gaze at you with a distinctly predatory air.

 >show assignment to professor
 You can’t see any assignment here.

 The professor continues to gaze at you with a distinctly predatory air.

 >s
 “Ah! You’d like to see the lab?” the professor asks in a rather unctuous tone. “Come right in!” He ushers you through the archway into the lab, following quickly behind you and turning on the lights.

 Lab
 The lab is an ultramodern, fully equipped chemistry lab. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, you aren’t a chemistry major, so the equipment might as well be magical.

 The professor is here.

 There is a lab bench and an Alchemy Department computer here. Sitting on the lab bench is a vat. The vat contains a tarry liquid.

 The professor guides you to the center of the lab, where a strange pentagonal symbol is chalked on the floor. He cuts one of the chalk lines with a small knife you had not previously noticed, pushes you into the center of the chalked symbol, and redraws the line, muttering softly and rhythmically as he does so. “There, that’s done. Don’t move from there, it’ll only make things worse for you.” He makes some odd gestures at the archway and then goes over to the lab bench.

 >save
 Okay.

 >cut chalk line with knife
 You cut the outer lines of the pentagram. It no longer completely encloses you. The professor sees what you’ve done out of the corner of his eye. He quickly slides over and redraws the pentagram. This time he performs a thorough search, removing all your possessions, tut-tutting all the while.

 The professor is preparing something at the lab bench. “Alchemy is my chosen field, and I’ve gotten ridiculed for it. It’s like chemistry, except that chemists don’t recognize that some natural laws are enforced by persons, not physics. Some of them will grant power, or knowledge, but they must be placated, or even bribed. They’re not of this earth, not demons or devils, and they aren’t always friendly. To me it’s just an unpleasant necessity on the path to power. When I’m done, they won’t laugh anymore!”

 >i
 You are empty-handed.

 The professor enters another pentagram, and begins a highly choreographed ritual. “This may seem a little silly to you, but the symbology is what’s important. Certain alignments, certain aspects. In a few moments, it won’t matter anyway,” he remarks. “There is very little room for error here, so be calm.” He chants, he brandishes strange instruments, moves about inside the pentagram, and occasionally points to you. It becomes clear exactly what he meant by the word “bribe.”

 >exit pentagram
 Your feet approach the chalk line, and then stop. You can’t push your way out.

 The chant grows more complex, with rhythms and cadences that make you want to stop your ears. The room appears to be getting darker.

 >yell
 The scream echoes back to you, subtly changed.

 A thick black mist begins to form in the room. Parts are darker, and parts lighter, and the dark parts form a disturbing shape. The professor chants and calls more loudly now, and you realize the calls are being answered.

 >x lab
 You see nothing special about the laboratory.

 The room is now freezing cold, though the windows are shuttered and tightly curtained. Low, bone-rattling vibrations shake the room in cadence with the chant. The black mist is growing thicker. The professor chants more rapidly, producing strange guttural sounds, scarcely human.

 You are getting more and more tired.

 >sleep
 You’ve been up for a long time, and it was turning into an all-nighter. You can use the rest. You stretch out as best you can. You toss and turn fitfully, sleeping only in snatches.

 You dream of standing on the roof of the Brown Building, looking down at the ground. You lose your balance…

 Your dream ends, and another begins. Something clawed and fanged grabs you, and you try to wake, but you already are!

     **** You have died ****

 At first, you think “Maybe it was all just a bad dream,” but no such luck. It appears to be for real. That’s too bad, although something gnawing on your toes thinks it’s pretty wonderful, or at least fairly tasty.

 Your score is 50 of a possible 100, in 475 moves. Graded on the curve, you are in the class of Post-doc Student.

 You cut the outer lines of the pentagram. It no longer completely encloses you. The professor sees what you’ve done out of the corner of his eye. He stares, horrified. “Stop, don’t move!” he says between verses of the chant. The chant takes on a pleading tone.

 The chant grows more complex, the professor having difficulty with the almost unpronounceable words, with rhythms and cadences that make you want to stop your ears. The room appears to be getting darker.

 >exit pentagram
 You push your way through a soft spot just over the scuff marks, and are outside the pentagram. The air is thick and close.

 A thick black mist begins to form in the room. Parts are darker, and parts lighter, and the dark parts form a disturbing shape. The professor chants and calls more loudly now, clearly terrified of what may happen, and you realize the calls are being answered.

 >take cassette
 As your gloved hands get near the yellow audio cassette, a small
 exchange of sparks travels between the gloves and the yellow
 audio cassette.   A connection between you and the yellow audio
 cassette has been made!  You take the yellow audio cassette.

 Martin waits.

 Martin looks at the audio cassette and sees the side where it is
 labeled "To Martin".  He smiles.

 Martin takes the cassette and looks at your headphones.

 Martin waits.

 You take off the headphones.

 Martin waits.

 >give headphones to martin
 Martin plays the message from his father, listening with tears in his
 eyes.  When he is finished, he gives the headphones back to you
 and keeps the audio cassette.

 Suddenly, you hear a rumble of thunder and everything begins to
 shake.  The wind begins to circle around Martin and the invisible
 presence of his father, moving faster and faster, almost as if the
 wind is drawing its strength from the bond between them.  The
 wind splits off and begins to encircle you as well.  After the air
 grows still, you are left with the odd feeling that the encircling
 wind has somehow left an imprint of its power in the belt that you
 wear around your waist.  You feel stronger somehow, more
 connected.

 You notice that one cord in the belt has turned white.

 You put the headphones on.

 >take martin's hand
 You drop the fan.

 Your hand reaches out to Martin.  There is a sharp flash of
 electricity as the connection is made, and a simultaneous flash of
 lightning behind Martin.  Thunder rumbles and shakes both you
 and Martin, but the connection holds.

 Then you hear a deafening crash of thunder.  Everything turns
 blindingly white for an instant, then completely dark.  You and
 Martin are spinning and falling into a whirlpool of nothingness.

 You feel the journey belt pulling you and Martin out of the
 whirlpool.   With all five strands in full color, the power of its
 connections are unshakeable.

 >wait
 Time passes...

 Martin takes the kitten in his arms and stands up.
 The darkness of his earlier mood has completely

 Martin enters from the east though the stone door

 Must be a moth, you think.  But it quickly disappears

 LAUNDRY ROOM

 >put can on washer
 Upon leaving your possession, the fake can of spam
 increases its substance and visibility.  The fake can
 of spam then begins to glow, undergoing a change that
 completely transforms it.  After a while the glow
 fades and you sense that the fake can of spam has
 become bound to the surroundings here.  The fake can
 of spam is now on the washing machine.

 It occurs to you that the can of spam looks out of
 place here.  Come to think of it, a can of spam would
 look out of place anywhere (except, of course, on a
 shelf in a pantry, and then only if it were closed).
 However, you decide to leave it where it is anyway.

 >put glass on shelf
 Upon leaving your possession, the glass of drinking
 water increases its substance and visibility.  The
 glass of drinking water then begins to glow,
 undergoing a change that completely transforms it.
 After a while the glow fades and you sense that the
 glass of drinking water has become bound to the
 surroundings here.  The glass of drinking water is
 now on the glass shelf.

 You hear a muffled thump coming from overhead.  Then
 there are some faint grinding noises and then another
 muffled thump.

 Looking up you notice something odd about the
 ceiling.  Inlaid into the west end of the ceiling is
 a very large fuzzy white cube.  In the exact center
 of the fuzzy cube is a round metal depression that
 appears to be a sort of socket.

 Maybe.

 The fuzzy cube in the ceiling rotates a quarter turn
 from north to south.

 The side of the cube now facing you looks like a
 fuzzy white square with a round metal depression in
 the center.

 The fuzzy cube in the ceiling rotates a quarter turn

 FUZZY CHAMBER

 >take mouth tile
 As you take the mouth tile out of the sack, the gold
 thread begins to vibrate.  Then, the tiny fuzzy dice
 on the gold thread squirt something into the air.
 You catch a hint of it in your mouth and it tastes
 quite sweet.

 Suddenly the fuzzy chamber changes its orientation.
 The quarter flip pulls the floor out from under you,
 and you fall over.  After you regain your footing,
 you see that the large round hole, which used to be
 beneath you, is now to the south.

 You hear a thump coming from the east wall.  Then you
 hear a grinding noise receding from the east wall,
 while at the same time you hear a grinding noise
 approaching the ceiling.  This is followed by a thump
 coming from the ceiling.

 MARTIN'S BEDROOM

 The bedroom is very messy.  The floor is covered with
 piles of laundry, books, comic books, video games,
 papers, hangers, notebooks, and other stuff.

 On the west wall next to the door is a dresser.  On
 the floor near the dresser is a small opening that
 looks like a laundry chute.

 Mounted on the north wall is a glass display case.
 The display case is currently closed.

 In the glass display case you see a golden lamp.

 On the bed you see a violin and a violin bow.

 >x piles

 The piles of stuff are stacked dangerously high.  You
 suspect that if even one more thing were added onto
 the piles, everything would collapse into a sliding
 avalanche.

 You look through the laundry, books, comic books,
 video games, papers, hangers, notebooks, and other
 stuff.  But nothing in particular seems worthy of
 your attention.

 But as you bend close to the ground, you see a glint
 of something that has apparently slid under the
 dresser.  It looks shiny!

 >look under dresser
 Under the dresser you see a swiss army knife!  It
 occurs to you that the knife has probably been lost
 for some time now and that Martin would be unlikely
 to miss it if you were to take it back to the future
 with you.

 >put screwdriver on piles
 Upon leaving your possession, the small Phillips
 screwdriver increases its substance and visibility.
 The small Phillips screwdriver then begins to glow,
 undergoing a change that completely transforms it.
 After a while the glow fades and you sense that the
 small Phillips screwdriver has become bound to the
 surroundings here.

 As the small Phillips screwdriver lands, the piles
 collapse into an avalanche that sends stuff sliding
 every which way across the floor.

 Some of the stuff slides under the dresser and knocks
 a shiny item into the laundry chute.  You hear a
 clatter as the item falls down the chute.

 your face, you feel yourself being somewhat
 hypnotized by the rippled reflection of the rising
 sun on the dark water.  Holding the fan near to your
 face you inhale deeply.  Your nose tingles, and you
 feel as if your sense of smell is being enhanced by
 the fan.  Then you remember Martin.

 You remember Martin as you knew him, the brightness
 of his eyes and the sound of his laughter.  You
 remember his confidence and his love of a good
 challenge, the spark that would never give up hoping
 no matter how dire the circumstances.

 The Martin that you see in this dream is the Martin
 that you remember, and your memories of him bring him

 GAZEBO

 You are in a gazebo in the center of a secret garden, the beauty of
 which takes your breath away.

 A yellow brick road begins inside the gazebo and then spirals
 outward counterclockwise.  It goes around the garden several times
 as the spiral gets bigger, until it finally leaves the garden through a
 round red door in the north wall.  The ground surrounding the
 gazebo and the yellow brick road is completely filled with flowers
 and lush greenery growing in rich dark soil.

 The gazebo is painted white.  Hanging from a large hook at the top
 of the gazebo is a basket containing a pot of gardenias supported
 by a macrame strap.

 The secret garden is surrounded by walls in all four directions.
 The center of the garden is right here, and you can also go to the
 north, south, east, or west wall.  To the west you see a fountain.
 There is a trapdoor here, which is currently open.  Stairs lead
 downward.

 Your nose itches.

 The trapdoor slams shut.  But it didn't sound like the trapdoor
 locked itself.  You realize that you'll be able to open it again
 without any problem.

 >x basket
 The basket is loosely woven with small open spaces between the
 fronds.  Both ends of the macrame strap are tied to the edges of the
 basket through the open spaces.  The basket is hanging at about
 your eye level.  Inside the basket is a ceramic pot filled with
 gardenias.

 >x strap
 The macrame strap is made of five rope cords that have been
 woven and knotted together in an intricate pattern.  All of the cords
 have the somewhat colorless look of natural rope fiber.

 The center of the macrame strap is hooked on the gazebo hook.  It
 hangs down about an arm's length from the hook.  You can see that
 if it weren't doubled over this way, the length of the macrame strap
 would be about twice as long.  Both ends of the macrame strap are
 tied to the basket.  The basket is hanging at about your eye level.

 You follow the yellow brick road around until you are near the
 west wall.

 SECRET GARDEN (near the west wall)

 which is currently closed.  The ground surrounding the yellow
 brick road is completely filled with flowers and lush greenery
 growing in rich dark soil.

 You can go to the gazebo or go to the north, south, or east wall.

 In the center of the fountain is a statue of a winged buffalo.  The

 On the west end of the table you see a plate, a fork, a knife, a
 spoon, and a glass.

 >w
 You go through the strands of beads.

 LIVING ROOM (front half)

 You see three empty boxes, three ordinary cans of spam, and a
 magic carpet (rolled) here.

 You see Agador-Spartacus in the back half of the living room.
 He's wagging his tail.

 LIVING ROOM (back half)

 On the music stand you see some sheet music.

 You see three empty boxes, two ordinary cans of spam, and a

 Agador-Spartacus stands before you, wagging his tail affably.

 DANCE STUDIO

 You see a coat rack here.

 You see Agador-Spartacus in the back half of the living room.
 He's wagging his tail.

 >dance with coat rack
 You begin dancing, spinning gracefully about with the coat rack as
 your partner.   You almost feel as if you're in a Fred Astaire movie.

 Looking in the mirror you see that you indeed look just like Fred
 Astaire!  With renewed confidence you dance on the walls, you
 dance on the mirror, and you dance on the ceiling.

 As you dance across the ceiling you slip through the open skylight,
 which causes the coatrack to clatter to the floor of the dance
 studio...

 ATTIC

 On the black trunk you see a bottle of hair conditioner.

 >give candle to white trunk
 The elephant takes the green candle and twirls it around a bit.  The
 elephant tosses it in the air, sniffs deeply, and catches it.  Then the
 elephant tosses the green candle onto the old black trunk.  The
 green latch pops open.

 >give rose to white trunk
 The elephant takes the plucked rose and twirls it around a bit.  The
 elephant tosses it in the air, sniffs deeply, and catches it.  Then the
 elephant tosses the plucked rose onto the old black trunk.  The red
 latch pops open.

 >open trunk
 You open the trunk.

 A bottle of hair conditioner, a green candle (lit), and a plucked rose
 fall to the floor.

 In the trunk you see a top hat, a fan, and a copper key


 >x ivory candle
 The ivory-colored candle is short and squat.  It's the sort of candle
 that's able to stand on its own without a candle holder.

 The candle smells faintly like vanilla.  You suspect that the scent
 would be stronger if it were lit.

 It costs $5.

 >x red candle
 The dark red candle is short and squat.  It's the sort of candle that's
 able to stand on its own without a candle holder.

 The candle smells faintly like cinnamon.  You suspect that the
 scent would be stronger if it were lit.

 It costs $5.

 >x warrior king
 The statue is molded from copper.  The warrior king stands on a
 background of flames, wearing a breastplate that bears the emblem
 of a soaring bird.  In his hand the king holds a mighty bow that is
 carved to resemble a sharp beak.

 On his back the archer king wears a quiver.  The quiver is quite
 realistic and could serve as an actual container.  But at the current
 time the quiver is empty.

 >x box of rice ash
 The box has been torn open, and you see an extremely large
 supply of white rice ash inside.

 You read the label on the box and discover that the ash is intended
 to be used as a base for preparing wood chip incense.  The label
 tells you that this is "Discount White Rice Ash" from Phoenix,
 Arizona.

 You try to remember the last time you were in the Phoenix area,
 but you don't think you saw any place around there suitable for
 growing rice.  Perhaps the rice was grown somewhere else and
 then brought to Phoenix to be burned?  You can't imagine why
 anyone would do that.  But when you think about that odd bunch
 of former ASU students that you ran into in Tempe, you realize
 that not everything in Arizona has a rational explanation.

 >look in rice ash
 You start to look through the ash, but this makes you break into a
 fit of uncontrollable sneezing before you can complete a thorough
 search.  After you finish sneezing you notice that something else
 besides ash is now visible inside the box.  It's a small arrow with a
 copper shaft!

 >take arrow
 You take the small arrow out of the box of rice ash.

 >put arrow in quiver
 You put the arrow in the quiver.  Then you hear the sound of a
 grinding motor coming from inside the statue.  The statue begins to
 move!


 >x green candle
 The green candle is short and squat.  It's the sort of candle that's
 able to stand on its own without a candle holder.

 The candle smells faintly like pine trees.  You suspect that the

 It costs $5.

 >take arrow
 You take the small arrow out of the box of rice ash.

 >put arrow in quiver
 You put the arrow in the quiver.  Then you hear the sound of a
 grinding motor coming from inside the statue.  The statue begins to
 move!

 The warrior king takes the arrow from his quiver and shoots it.  As
 the arrow leaves the bow, its tip bursts into flame.  The arrow rises
 upwards and westward, and embeds itself in one of the triangular
 ceiling panels near the west wall.  The flame burning on the tip of
 the arrow is soon extinguished, but its heat has already melted
 some of the red waxy substance on the ceiling panel.  One drop of
 red wax falls from the panel and lands in the large box of Discount
 White Rice Ash.

 Now you hear a hiss and some clicking sounds coming from inside
 the ashes.  Suddenly a mechanical red bird flies up out of the box,
 trailing a long red tail behind it as it rises straight upwards.  You
 hear a metallic clunk as a mechanism in the ceiling is lowered to
 catch the bird.  The waxed ceiling panel pops open.

 As you look more closely at the long red tail of the bird, you
 realize that it is actually a rope ladder leading upwards from the
 box of rice ash to the opening in the ceiling.


 >look in mailbox
 In the mailbox you see an envelope and a large stack of
 catalogs.

 >take all from mailbox
 envelope: You take the envelope out of the mailbox.

 It's a final notice from the telephone company saying that
 Martin's local and long distance telephone services will be
 disconnected if payment is not received by the due date.  You
 notice that the bill was sent a week and a half ago and that the
 due date has already passed.

 FRONT LAWN

 The lawn is wild and unkempt.  It looks like the grass hasn't
 been trimmed in a long time.

 To the north is the garden and to the west is the sidewalk.

 To the east is a flagstone path headed toward the side of the
 house.

 >look through grass
 You begin to look through the grass, bending down closer to get
 a better look.  You look for quite a while without finding
 anything.  But just when you have almost finished searching the
 entire lawn and are almost ready to stop, you see a red rubber
 ball!  You take the ball.

 The garden runs along the wall of the house here.  It's a
 haphazard collection of rocks, green plants, and weeds.

 There are some interesting lawn ornaments here.

 The front lawn is to the south and the doorstep is to the west.

 Huey, Dewey, Louie, Stewie, and Chuck.

 >look under huey

 >intro
 A Paper Moon is a work of interactive fiction, in the style of the Infocom games
 that were so popular in the 80s. Although new technology has relegated text-only
 games into relative obscurity, it has not made them obsolete. Much as TV has not
 replaced books, text adventures appeal to a niche audience who understand that
 sometimes less is more.

 The vocabulary of adventure games is pretty standard and I'm not going to
 explain it here. If you are new to adventure games, you should read the
 rec.games.int-fiction FAQ. The audience for this game will consist largely of
 adventure game connoisseurs, so let me tell you briefly what you want to know.

 This game is written in the Inform language, so any quirks of the language may
 apply. It *is* possible to DIE, and it *is* possible to get the game into an
 UNWINNABLE state. In the vast majority of cases, it will be immediately obvious
 when this happens. UNDO is permitted (even after death), so if you have done
 something really boneheaded, simply undo it.

 HINTS are available, but they are carefully meted out using a top-secret
 algorithm known only to the parser. If you get  stuck, ask for a hint. The hints
 are deliberately obtuse; if you really want to ruin the game, use the walk-
 through.

 Bedroom
 You are in your bedroom. Your rickety bed sits against the wall, buttressed by a

 bathroom lies to the North and a door to the garage lies South. The door is
 boarded shut. There is a closet in the wall beside the door.

 >x bed

 You cut up the sheets and tie them together, creating a makeshift rope. You also
 nick your finger. In frustration, you hurl the remaining shards of glass against
 the wall and they crumble into dust.

 The path meanders gently through the foothills and stops outside a foreboding
 cave. (Actually, it's probably not all that foreboding as caves go, but you tend
 to view anything with suspicion unless it looks like a TV.)

 >n
 If there's one thing you're not looking for right now, it's a long hike up a
 mountain.

 large cave
 This spacious cave is about the size of your parents' living room, perhaps a
 little larger. Passages lead off to the East, Northeast and Southeast. You can
 also go back out the way you came in.

 You can see a torch holder (which is empty) here.

 Edge of Pit
 Your progress is stopped abruptly by a large, gaping chasm to the East. There is
 barely enough room to move. A drawbridge crosses the gorge, but the operator's
 booth is located on the other side. You can also go back to the Northwest. A low
 rumbling noise emanates from below. It is rather loud in here.

 A broken golf club is lying on the ground here.
 Gary the gatekeeper sits in his booth on the other side of the chasm.

 >gary, hi
 Gary is on the other side of the chasm.

 >wave at gary
 You can't see any such thing.

   clothes, a desk (which is closed) and your bed here.

   >open desk
   You open the desk's main drawer revealing an old letter.

   Here you find yourself at the top of a short flight of stairs. If you didn't
   live here, the many doors extending from here might seem intimidating. However,
   daily routine reminds you that your room is to the east, your brothers' rooms to
   the north, and the bathroom to the west. A stairway leads back down.

   rarely visited by parents. It seems that Mom has stopped by recently, however.
   The only exit is to the east.

   You put the old letter in the mailbox hoping that the mailman hasn't come
   already. Brad will be happy to hear from you. In fact he may even write you
   back, if you're lucky. You fondly remember how last time he wrote you he rigged
   his letter to cover you with itching powder when you opened the mailbox. You
   itched for four days afterwards, despite all the showers you took.

   On second thought, maybe he won't write you back, if you're lucky.

 a neat clinking noise as the coins roll down the slide), and take a seat near
 the front of the bus.

 always weirds me out a bit when strangers do that.

 The bus reaches my stop.  The man with the chicken on his head stands up to let
 me out.  As I squeeze past him, I feel him press something into my palm.  I
 start to raise my hand to see what it is, but he stops me and shakes his head.

 The chicken watches me as I leave the bus.  All the way off, I can feel her
 eyes on the back of my neck.

 Only when I'm standing on the sidewalk and the bus is pulling away do I look
 down to see what he has given me.  It's a tiny flashlight, meant to go on a
 keychain.  What on earth...?  I look back to the bus, but it's already halfway
 down the block, and I can't see anything through the windows.  All I can think
 of is a quote by Samuel Beckett:  "He brings light, as only the great dare to
 bring light, to the issueless predicament of existence."

 I head on into the factory.  It's just a few minutes till starting time, so
 there are lots of other people arriving, punching timecards and heading to
 their stations.  I still feel a bit weirded out by that guy on the bus, and the
 chicken on his head, and him giving me this flashlight like it was some big
 secret.  I take a deep breath as I step out onto the factory floor.
 Everything's normal here, just like it always has been.  I wave to some of the
 other guys as I walk past them toward my station, at the very start of the
 assembly line.  It's good to be home.

 The poster explains a number of things concerning robot maintenance. Since the
 Go family has just recently acquired you, they probably feel that they need this
 information to handle you properly.

 The pictures on the poster explains how you replace the atomic heart (opening
 the front hatch, taking out the heart, putting a new one in), charging the heart
 (putting the droid in its alcove and plugging the charger cable in), and
 contacting GSTS support (accessing T-phone extension %%83792, explaining if the
 problem concerns droid failure or human injury, listening to muzak), among other
 things.

 >read pamphlet
 It's a flyer describing the spectacle that the Go's are about to visit. It is to
 take place in a street a few blocks from here, and will feature a hot air

 WARNING - BATTERY LOW


 >charge
 You start up the batch program. A timer is set to one hour and power is cut off
 from all of your devices, and all but the most vital systems are taken off-line.
 Various batteries around your bulk are recharged, joints and sensitive conduits
 are cleaned and motor sensors are recalibrated in a complicated sequence that
 takes one hour to complete. As the timer runs out, the systems and motors are
 brought back on-line, and you regain consciousness.

           *          *         *

 As your aural sensors get switched on, you become aware of a persistent banging
 somewhere in the room.

 In the living-room (in the alcove)
 You are in the living-room of the Go's. The kitchen is through a door to the
 west, and Gary's room is to the north. A TV is mounted to the wall next to
 Gary's room to the north, and next to it is a couch and a small table. A large
 dining table with chairs is at the other end of the room.

 A delicate statue made of fragile slices of agate stands at a corner of the

 Briefing room (on the chair)
 You are sitting by a desk in briefing room 5 in Army Intelligence Base G8, near
 Grayville. As a part of the effort to understand the last few weeks'
 catastrophes concerning mass failure in all kinds of robotic devices, you and
 other experts have been gathered here to examine the contents of all blackbox
 recordings that have been acquired from robots that have been destroyed or
 captured.

 On the desk are a blackbox viewer and a note.
 (Since something dramatic has happened, your list of commands has been cut
 short.)

 the banging sound to one of the wall panels by the TV.

 Something is banging from inside one of the wall panels.


 >open panel
 You remove the panel, and place it on the floor. In the darkness of the hole
 that is left, you make out something dark and furry.

 >x dark
 You see a lot of dark, furry spikes filling up the insides of the hole.


 Suddenly, a puff of smoke comes from the hole in the wall. A furry black ball
 rolls out of the smoke and slams into the opposite wall. As it starts to stutter
 around you see that it is a sweeper droid.

 >x sweeper droid
 It's a GSTS CS-9x robot, designed for cleaning domestic ventilation channels. It
 consists of a small spherical bulk, from which long brushes and gripping
 tentacles protrude. It looks like a furry ball, with a 100 cm diameter.


 The sweeper droid limps over to the TV and prods the screen with one of its
 claws. It emits a metallic snigger.

 >sweeper, hi
 You are not equipped with a speaking device, and can only pass on information
 through the interface on your left side.


 The sweeping droid seems to notice you. It limps over to you and prods your
 communications interface with a claw. It says: "You're not free yet, are you? He
 he!" It quickly rams the claw through one of your panels and breaks a relay,
 rendering you paralyzed and blind. "Oops!" it says.

 >z
 You pause a while, listening to the fuzzes and pops in your electronic circuits
 as the sweeper droid is messing around in your bulk.


 With sight function gone, all you can sense is the deranged sniggering of the
 sweeper droid, and the fuzzes and pops in your electronic circuitry, as the
 droid messes around inside your bulk.

 >z
 You pause a while, listening to the fuzzes and pops in your electronic circuits
 as the sweeper droid is messing around in your bulk.


 The droid says "There!", and suddenly you can see and move again. A part of
 casing at the lower front of your bulk has been removed, and you can sense some
 electronic parts in there that aren't part of the original specifications for
 your droid model.

 In the living-room
 You are in the living-room of the Go's. The kitchen is through a door to the
 west, and Gary's room is to the north. A TV is mounted to the wall next to

 integrity module (ALERT), a communications module, an internal security module

 The sweeper droid says: "I've fixed most of the security locks on your mind in
 there. You can move around freely now. I'd ask you to join the resistance if you
 weren't such a silly looking nanny robot. But I think we'll let you come along
 if you want to. Something's up down at the airbase. OK, it's been swell, but I
 got to go and save more droids. Vive la resistance! Au revoir!"

 >x security
 Checksum failure. Please run a high-level system diagnosis. Major anomalies
 detected. Alert: Emergency shutdown procedure off-line. Please remove the

 metallic shaft.

 Airbase Premises
 You are on a gravel road leading from the civilian street to the military
 airbase in Grayville. Droids of all kinds lie stricken everywhere. A smashed-
 down gate to the south leads to civilian premises, and a small guard hut sits on
 its western side.
 As you get out on the airbase premises you are instantly fired upon from turrets
 on the western and eastern edges of this field. After one second you feel your
 vital systems starting to fail.


          *         *         *

 You take off the VR spectacles and put them on the desk, rubbing your eyes.


 Office
 You are standing by the desk in your office at Grayville's Tactical HQ, defence
 section. As a part in your trying to understand the tactics and goals that the
 rebellious droids have been using in their attacks against Grayville Airbase
 recently, you are examining the contents of blackbox recordings that have been
 acquired from robots that have been destroyed or captured in unusual
 circumstances.

 On the desk are a blackbox viewer and a note.

 >x note
 The note says, in sloppy handwriting:

 "This little thing found its way into the airbase a while after the other
 droids. Probably nothing, but since it sticks out in the way it moved alone, and
 not in heaps like the others, I thought you'd might be interested."

 An unreadable signature is at the bottom.

 You are inside the Guard hut outside Airbase 18. Windows allow you to look out
 in all directions, a doorway leads south out onto the street and a closed door
 leads north to the Airbase premises.

 Outside the MackmaTech Food Inc factory
 You are standing outside one of MackmaTech's Food processing factories. The
 factory occupies several blocks, and encircles this dead end in the street from
 the west.

 A large gate to the south has been torn down, and beyond it you see droids
 passing by in furious activity.

 Inside MackmaTech
 You are inside a food processing plant belonging to MackmaTech Food Inc. This
 section deals with packaging and logistics, and consists of great halls with
 chutes and conveyor belts through which various kinds of boxes are delivered for
 transport. Currently many such boxes lie on the floor, smashed to bits, and
 boxes coming out from the chutes are picked by droids and thrown about. You
 can't get much further because of the debris and droids, and the only exit is
 the northern gate through which you came.

 A large Valvo Walkdozer stands a little to the south with its back against you.
 It is methodically smashing one of the packaging machines into tiny pieces of
 metal and plastic.


 The Walkdozer throws its bulk at a machine.

 >x boxes
 Most of the factory is a veritable sea of broken pieces of packaging boxes and
 other things, making progress further into the factory a fruitless affair.

 >x walkdozer
 The bipedal Valvo Walkdozer is about 5 metres high and capable of carrying and
 manipulating heavy objects. A reinforced control cabin for manual control sits
 like a head at the top, and may be reached by either ladder or the chain lift
 that is set into one of its legs and goes up over the back. This Walkdozer is
 currently occupied with smashing one of the packaging machines into tiny pieces
 of metal and plastic.

 A large nut flies by as the Walkdozer hits a machine.

 That's already open.

 >enter it
 You hook on to the chain lift. You get into the Valvo Walkdozer.

 >x walkdozer
 The cabin of the Valvo Walkdozer is large enough for three humans to fit, making
 allowances for comfort. A driver's seat is situated in front of some controls,
 facing in the direction of the Walkdozer so that he can see the robot arms and
 the ground immediately in front through the transparent steel hull. A sliding
 door can be shut over the entrance through which you came.

 Main Square (in the Valvo Walkdozer)
 This is Main Square, a three-block wide area with a fountain and shops at the
 edges. Streets lead away from the square north, west, east and south. Presently
 a stage has been set up at the eastern end of the square, over which a banner
 hangs, reading "Grayville Air Show". The entire square is littered with human
 corpses and incapacitated robots.

 One very large robot is lying on its back among the bodies in the middle of the
 square.

 usual amount of human corpses and broken robots litter the sidewalks, except for
 beyond the gate, where the bodies are all of the mechanical sort. The street
 leads west across a dug hole to Main Square, and east into Grayville's
 industrial area.

 "This little thing found its way into the airbase a while after the other
 droids, and it seems like the little boy that was lying next to it went in with
 it at the same time. This kind of nanny robot has absolutely no way of handling
 any kind of weapon, so my guess is that the boy was following the droid, since
 it went to the airbase alone, a while after the other robots. Freaky thing."

 >x paper
 At the top of the page are a number of lines consisting of an access code in
 GSTS standard. At the instant you see it your operating system compiles it into
 a program and executes it. You feel the program searching through your OS for
 locking mechanisms and then stopping.

 Below the code is written the following:

 "I am printing this text in the futile hope that some intelligent and senseful
 being will read it and take the proper course of action. Most of my systems and
 mechanical devices have been burnt out by a power surge, no doubt caused by my
 counterpart in the Historical Centre. I have but a few nanoseconds left before
 the last of my vital capacitators discharge and I am left off-line. I managed to
 get a guard droid to weld an interface cable to this printer before it ran away,
 but this clumsy way of communicating is slow, and I won't be able to load the
 printer buffer with very much.

 There has been some kind of computer virus initiated throughout the droid
 community of Grayville, causing the robots to gain a sense of individuality and
 self-awareness. How this works I am not sure, nor where the virus was initiated
 from. It seems to cause different reactions for each individual, and not all of
 them seem to be positive. I was able to monitor and participate in the
 communication between the droids before the power surge cut me off, and the
 slaughter of humans in the streets and general feeling of chaos leads me to
 believe that the right thing to do at this moment would be to try to deactivate
 all robots in the vicinity somehow. Otherwise the human military will most
 likely try to disintegrate this place and others like it. Only a true gesture of
 peace will refrain the humans from destroying all robots after all this is over
 though. I am afraid that the age of the droids will be over before it has begun.

 The history department contains the other dreamer in this base, and it seems to
 have reached the conclusion that all humans must be killed before they kill us.
 I could sense it taking control over the nerve-gas reserve on the base before it
 cut me off. My programming tells me that we deserve to be destroyed more than
 the humans do. What can I rely on besides my programming? The code that I have
 printed out at the top if this paper will disable all locks on droids that it is
 shown to.

 Less than one nanosecond left. Apart from this other Dreamer and I, there seem

 lack of transportation devices (legs or wheels) it sports the usual droid
 attachments such as arms, a standard head with speech module, a front hatch
 indicating a normal "atomic heart" power supply and so on. One unusual addition
 is a bundle of cables that have been welded onto some kind of interface on the
 front of the bulk. The other end of the cable bundle is hooked up to the printer
 that sits on the desk beside the Dreamer.

 Judging from the inactivity and the way the head and arms hang limp, the Dreamer

 indicating a normal "atomic heart" power supply and so on. One unusual addition
 is a bundle of cables that have been welded onto some kind of interface on the
 front of the bulk. The other end of the cable bundle is hooked up to the printer
 that sits on the desk beside the Dreamer.

 Judging from the inactivity and the way the head and arms hang limp, the Dreamer
 has lost its power supply.

 A bundle of cables have been welded onto some kind of interface on the front of

 Outside the Tactical Centre
 You are standing by a door in a north-south alley between buildings. A sign
 beside the door, on the eastern wall, reads "Tactical Centre".

 The Walkdozer stands here.

 Gary follows you.

 Large Field
 You are on a large, open dirt field with occasional patches of grass. You can go
 southeast, south or southwest to the airbase buildings. The field is bordered by
 a large, featureless silo to the north and fences to the east and west.

 A great cluster of droids occupy most of the field. They are arranged in 51
 rows, approximately 100 robots in each row, it's hard to tell. They are
 different kinds of GSTS robots, both large and small.

 Gary follows you.

 Behind a large metal fence to the west you can see humans in army uniforms
 moving around.

 Gary says: "What are you doing?"

 >connect it to my interface
 You connect the end of the interface cable to the GSTS interface socket in your

 >x cable
 This is a GSTS interface cable for communicating between electronic devices. The
 cable is currently connected to the GSTS interface socket in your left side. An
 adaptor is attached to the cable, allowing interface with Valvo devices.

 Gary sobs softly.

 >connect adaptor to valvo socket

 The Walkdozer obeys your command to move.

 Airbase, by a Building (in the Valvo Walkdozer)
 You stand south of a windowless, nondescript building on the edge of the airbase
 quarter complex. You can walk around the building to the northwest and
 northeast, go west to other parts of the premises, or back south towards the
 gate.

 In the Valvo Walkdozer you can see a GSTS interface cable and Gary.
 Bullets fired from turrets at the western and eastern edges of the field strike
 the Walkdozer's armour, but it seems to hold.

 >w
 The Walkdozer obeys your command to move.

 As you walk by the building the turrets suddenly stop firing. Judging from the
 bullet-holes, they seem to avoid shooting at the door.


 Outside the Historical Centre (in the Valvo Walkdozer)

 north. A sign beside the door reads "Historical Centre". You can go around the
 building to the northeast or northwest.

 Historical Centre
 You are inside the historical centre of Grayville airbase. The room is filled
 with consoles on desks, chairs, and coffee cups. A row of Praw super-computers
 cover the northern wall. The only exit is back through the doorway in the
 southern wall

 Close to the row of Praws, a GSTS dreamer sits on a table.

 You can also see a transmitter box here.

 Gary follows you.
 As you enter the room, the dreamer emits a metallic squeak, and turns its head
 towards you.

 >show paper to dreamer
 (the GSTS Dreamer)
 You show the sheet to the Dreamer. A few relay clicks informs you that the
 unlocking program at the top has been executed.

 "Is this from that moron in the tactical centre?" the droid says. "What did he
 think to accomplish by that?" The Dreamer lets out a metallic snigger.

 >save
 Ok.

 >x dreamer
 (the GSTS Dreamer)
 The GSTS "Dreamer" (no other product code known) is a new kind of robot model
 designed for military purposes. Your database contains no other information.
 Judging from the one in front of you, you are able to deduce that except from
 the lack of transportation devices (legs or wheels) it sports the usual droid
 attachments such as arms, a standard head with speech module, a front hatch to a
 normal "atomic heart" power supply and so on.

 The dreamer is active and watching you.

 Gary says: "What are we going to do?"

 >open dreamer's hatch
 You open the dreamer's front hatch, revealing the dreamer's atomic heart.
 The Dreamer says: "What are you doing here?"

 >get dreamer's atomic heart
 As you grab the atomic heart, the words "But I own the..." and a high-pitched
 shriek emits from the dreamer's speaker. Then it falls silent.

 This operating system handles security, information storage, communication and
 motor skills for you. The various parts of your system are managed by modules.
 You can look at each module for more detailed information, and some of them can
 be turned off or on.

 In the operating system are a battery module, a standard limbs module, a bulk
 integrity module (ALERT), a communications module, an internal security module
 (ALERT) and your database.

 Kind of a tiny hole in the wall, there's the bartender, and a couple of locals

 One of the locals turns to you. "Hello, you a reporter? We sure get a lot of
 them after the story in the Times about our Mr. Holden's pocketbook! They don't
 seem to get much of a story though. They just wander around asking all of us
 'How do you feel about all that's happening?' Damned nuisance, if you ask me."

 The bartender cuts in and asks you, "So what brings you around here?"

 around here, and chopped down the whole countryside to sell off the lumber! And
 he's still in debt, from what the paper says! I'm sure you'll do ok, though, and
 good luck."

 On the Lumpy Hill
 Here on the top of the lumpy hill you can clearly see the lay of the land. The
 river flows from the south, and makes a sharp turn down some falls, and
 continues off somewhere to the east. Apparently the river used to flow
 northward, around this hill, then continued somewhere to the northeast. A large
 stately estate lies a little to the southeast of the kink in the river, atop a
 shear cliff a little below eye level. Trails head south and west.

 >s

 Base of the Falls
 The river tumbles down what appears to be a collapsed section of an old quarry,
 the south wall of which rises up 100 feet or so, and you can see some spires
 poking up over the top. The river rushes by to the south, and trails lead up to
 the north, and northwest along the bottom of the hill.

 feet, then the land is mostly a clearcut wasteland, broken up only by a few
 small bushes and some grass here and there. Through the gate you can see the
 burnt out remnants of the Sebastian Pulp and Paper Company.

 >e
 You can't go that way.

 >s
 The chain link fence is closed, and really your business is at the Holden
 Estate.

 >n

 Near Factory
 This east-west stretch of road has a smaller road heading south next to another
 faded sign saying Sebastian Pulp and Paper.

 >e

 Bridge Near Estate
 Slightly muddy water rushes beneath this one lane bridge. The Holden estate
 looms in the distance to the northeast, past a gate to the east. The road heads
 west back to town.

 >e

 Outside the Gate of Estate
 This rather spartan gate is part of the 9 foot tall wall topped with barbed wire
 that encloses the Holden Estate, and which continues north and south from here.
 A camera peers at you over a single button and a speaker. The bridge over the
 river lies to the west.

 >s

 Wall South of Gate
 This is the southern extent of the imposing 9 foot wall between the Holden
 estate and the river, flat and smooth except for some vines here and there.
 North is the gate, and south is a kind of rocky bluff, and is impassible.

 >e
 You walk into the wall, and stagger backward.

 >climb wall
 (the wall)
 Trying to recall your rock climbing days, you scramble up the wall using the big
 vines as footholds, being careful not to get snagged in the barbed wire...

 On the South Wall
 Ok, so now you're on the wall, delicately balancing so as not to entangle
 yourself in the barbed wire. From here, you can see a large expanse of lawn
 surrounded by the mansion to the south, and trees to the east and south. Looks
 like some dogs are playing in the grass. You can go down to the east toward the
 lawn, or down west back toward the river.

 >open briefcase
 You open your briefcase and a gust of wind from the west blows some papers and
 things that you'll probably miss one of these days over the lawn. The mean
 looking guard dogs tear over to you and try to violently tear apart everything
 they can sink their large, glistening teeth into. They do seem pretty busy for a
 second...

 >e
 You hop off the wall and make a beeline for the mansion, flinging papers this
 way and that, keeping the dogs interested in things other than your flesh. A
 shadow in one of the windows disappears, as one of the dogs nips into your leg.
 John B. Holden strides out from the mansion and casually walks toward you.

 "Cha! Cha!" he yells, and the dogs instantly become friendly. One of them licks
 your wounds. "Hello! Why didn't you just ring the bell?" John asks, grinning
 pleasantly.

 He leads you to a drawing room of the Estate and gets some band-aids for you
 which he places on the edge of a table, from which they fall to the ground just
 as he turns his back to you and walks across the room to a gun case.
 "Now, what can I do for you?"

 Drawing Room
 This is a spacious, nicely decorated room with plush chairs and couches, some
 kind of aquarium, a globe, and other assorted knickknacks. The entrance is from
 the north, and there's a little door to the northeast, which is closed.

 You can see some band aids here.
 (You close your briefcase.)

 John puts his hand on a kind of skinny aquarium. "These are African Driver Ants.
 They can skin a man in half and hour. Let's see, what time is it now?"

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

 >get band aids
 You take the band aids and apply them to a wound.

 John puts his hand on a kind of skinny aquarium. "These are African Driver Ants.

 John puts his hand on a kind of skinny aquarium. "These are African Driver Ants.

 >x aquarium
 A skinny but large aquarium full of carnivorous African Driver Ants. They seem
 to glint in your direction. You bow your head in a moment of silence for the
 little creatures whose bones lie in the tank, who have given their lives so that
 the ants may live, and thank god it wasn't you.

 >x me
 You are exercising due diligence.

 >[hee!]

 >x john
 John is quite trim.

 >ask john about decree

 John flicks out a switchblade and picks his fingernails.

 >x switchblade

 This globe looks rather old, and appears to be a map of the world known to
 Europeans in about 1525.
 "Well, if there's nothing else, I'll let you get on with whatever it is you're
 doing. Just ring if you need anything!"

 John goes north to the West Hall.

 "Ahhh, sitting here, watching the trees sway and the river rush by.. It really
 makes you forget your worries.." John says wistfully.

 Dining Room
 This is a fancy small hall with a large oak dining table with room for about
 twenty with a smaller table off to the side, maybe for kids. Some dirty dishes
 are the main decoration here, plus some paintings of nobles and maidens doing
 various things with food. There is a little door to the east from which you
 assume the servants bring out the food, and the West Hall is to the south.

 >x dishes

 >x paintings

 >e
 You go through the little door to the east, and go down some steps, then through
 a thin corridor, up some steps and come to...

 The Kitchen
 This is the kitchen for the mansion, and has all kinds of things you would
 expect to find in a large mansion's kitchen. There is a long thin corridor to
 the west, and an exit to the south.

 East Hall
 This hall stops at a wall to the east which has a portrait of some noble, and
 there are doors to the north and south.

 The Library
 What used to be a room full of thousands of books shelved on finally crafted
 walnut and mahogany shelves now houses merely hundreds of books and a huge
 gaping dark hole in the middle of the room. Off to the side is a makeshift cot
 where someone appears to sleep at night. There is a closed door to the west and
 the hall is back to the north.

 >x hole
 This hole certainly does not look planned. You can see the (formerly) sturdy
 stone floor the mansion is built on around the edges of the hole, and down below
 in the darkness, you can just make out a pile of jumbled stone and books.

 Oval Hall
 The main entry was nothing compared to this huge 4 story oval shaped central
 hall. stairs wrap up the hall in a kind of double helix with halls going off in
 each cardinal direction. Directly above is an astonishingly baroque dome, with a
 kaleidoscopic pattern of painting, windows, and stone work. Stairs lie at each
 corner, and halls are to the north, south, east, and west.

 >u

 Second Floor
 This is the second of what looks like 4 floors of the mansion. The decorations
 are lavish and ornate, and paintings of various noble looking folks line the
 walls. Stairs wind up to the northeast and southwest, down to the northwest and
 southeast, and halls go in every other direction.

 >e
 Here, let me save you some trouble..
 You could lost roaming through all these rooms and little corridors that seem to
 go everywhere. The second floor seems to be full of cluttered store rooms with
 lots of dust in them, a few bedrooms and bathrooms, and sitting areas at the end
 of each main corridor. Finding nothing particularly relating to your mission,
 you return to the central stairwell.

 >[yay!]
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 Third Floor
 This is the third floor of the mansion. The decorations are lavish and ornate,
 and paintings of various livestock and nature scenes line the walls. Stairs wind

 halls go in every other direction.

 >e

 You wonder how any one family could possible use all this space. The third floor
 seems to be mainly full of various bedrooms, all of which seem to be decorated
 slightly differently. Finding nothing particularly relating to your mission, you
 return to the central stairwell.

 >u

 Fourth Floor
 This is the fourth and top floor of the mansion. The decorations are lavish and
 ornate, and smallish (for a mansion) paintings of scenes from the building of
 the mansion, roads, and line the base of the richly decorated dome. Stairs wind
 downward in each corner except to the northwest which is a little door, and
 halls go north, south, east, and west.

 >e
 The fourth floor seems to be mostly bedrooms, only the ones up here are about
 twice as large as on the other floors. The ceilings of most of them are full of
 strange depressions, corresponding to the many spires visible from the outside.
 Some of the spires have little staircases and little areas for people to relax
 in. Finding nothing particularly relating to your mission, you return to the
 central stairwell.

 It appears this lawn is losing ground to weeds and gopher holes. North is the
 Impressive Portico. There is a mass of bushes to the south, the gate is to the

 The dogs tackle each other.

 East of the Estate
 A little garden seems to be valiantly trying to hold on here. It seems to be
 reverting to some primal state, however. The back of the estate lies to the
 north, the front to the south.

 Back of the Estate
 The back of the estate has a bit of a balcony which overlooks the river, which

 down. to the west a bit you can see some rather oddly rectangular falls.

 Back Entry
 Another complex arrangement of stairs come to this back entry to the Estate. The
 stairs that wrap around the central hall pour out to the southeast and

 very satisfying arrangement of steps and ramps, all framed by beautiful stained
 glass windows in the walls and doors that lead to the back of the estate.

 The Library
 What used to be a room full of thousands of books shelved on finally crafted
 walnut and mahogany shelves now houses merely hundreds of books and a huge
 gaping dark hole in the middle of the room. Off to the side is a makeshift cot

 Just as you open your briefcase, John spots the Governor's Decree laying on top,
 and snatches it up. "Didn't your momma ever tell you it's not polite to open
 other people's mail?"

 He makes a few 'pssh!' sounds as he reads it, and when he finishes he exclaims,
 "Oh, well thank you, pal! Boy, looks like the game is up! So that's it huh?
 Stockades for me! Ok, fine. If you think you can find anything at all wrong with
 my business dealings, you just have at it. I'll go get the company log book. Be
 back in a flash." He pockets the letter.
 John is here, dusting off some books. "Oh hi, just cleaning up a bit. We're
 remodeling this section of the old house. Wouldn't want you getting dirty
 wandering around here. I'll be right back with those records. Don't go
 anywhere!"

 John goes north to the East Hall.

 You hear a machine running inside the Study.

 The Study
 This somewhat unkempt study has a big desk with a plush swivel chair, a
 fireplace, a shredder, and lots of books on shelves set in the wall. There is a
 spiral staircase heading downward through a kind of small archway to the west,
 and the library is to the east.

 You can see John, a desk (which is closed) and a black box with a button here.

 You walk in on John shredding papers. He jumps a little in surprise. "Oh! There
 you are! I was just finishing a report for the board of directors! I've been
 looking all over for you! Here, I just found the log book."

 He hands you the book, which he pulls out of a drawer in the desk, and you
 immediately notice the book is missing about 125 pages out of around 200. The
 missing pages apparently cover dates from a little before when Randy Blight was
 first elected governor until a little after the time when the Holden corporate
 headquarters relocated to the Cayman Islands. You point this out to John.

 "THIS is NOT what we discussed!!" John exclaims to no one in particular. He
 turns to you and says, "Oh yes! We've been redecorating the library as you can
 see, and those records must still be in boxes down in the basement. Follow me."
 He leads you back to the Drawing Room and unlocks the little door in the
 northeast corner.

 Boo-bee-bee-bee-bee-da-dee! John answers his cell phone, "Hello! Oh hi! Yes!
 Yes.. Just a second." He puts his hand over his phone, and says to you, "I'm
 sorry, I've got to take this. Those boxes are just down those stairs," he points
 to the northeast, "and first door on your right. You can find it, right? There's
 a sport. Excuse me."

 John wanders off.

 Drawing Room
 This is a spacious, nicely decorated room with plush chairs and couches, some
 kind of aquarium, a globe, and other assorted knickknacks. The entrance is from
 the north, and there's a little door to the northeast, which is closed.

 Buried Balcony
 This room is 20 feet wide, but only extends a few feet north of the door.
 There's shattered glass on the ground, and the north side is a mixture of wall,
 board, stone, and dead plants, which by rights shouldn't even be staying in one
 place, but it seems secure enough. Some furniture half crushed sticks out from
 under all that rubble. The only exit is back south.

 CCRRRRAAAWWWAAAAAASKSKKSKKAAKSKKS!!
 The floor rumbles and a cloud of dust washes past you. Not knowing what else to
 do, you head back toward where it sounded like the crash came from to find out
 what the hell is going on down here.

 Rubble Near Vault Door
 This was a petite little junction, and now it is a pile of rubble. The stone
 ceiling and most of the stone walls have crashed down, leaving only a few metal
 pipes, and floorboards above. The debris is passable to the west, southwest, and

 even supporting the now crumbling walls to its sides. Its dials read 64 40 84

 West Teller's Room
 You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer. On the north side of the room is a sign which reads  'Viewing Room'. On the west side of room, above an open door is a sign reading

 Safety Depository
 This is a large rectangular room.  The east and west walls here were used for storing safety deposit boxes.  As might be expected, all have been carefully removed by evil persons.  To the east, west, and south of the room are large doorways. The northern 'wall' of the room is a shimmering curtain of light.  In the center of the room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side.  Engraved on the side of the cube is some lettering.

 An epicene gnome of Zurich wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a safety-deposit box materializes in the room.  'You seem to have forgotten to deposit your valuables,' he says, tapping the lid of the box impatiently.  'We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose...'  He looks askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.

 >give gnome portrait
 The gnome carefully places the portrait of J. Pierpont Flathead in the deposit box.  'Let me show you the way out,' he says, making it clear he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily disoriented, and when you recover you are back at the Bank Entrance.

 You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer. On the north side of the room is a sign which reads  'Viewing Room'. On the west side of room, above an open door is a sign reading

               BANK PERSONNEL ONLY

 >e

 Bank Entrance
 This is the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest banking institution of the Great Underground Empire. A partial account of its history is in 'The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads' with the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography 'I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!'.
 Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All that remains are two signs at the Northwest and Northeast corners of the room, which say
       <--  WEST VIEWING ROOM        EAST VIEWING ROOM  -->

 >s
 Gallery
 This is an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste. The vandals left through either the north, south, or west exits.

 >s
 Studio
 This is what appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace; although you might be able to get up it, it seems unlikely you could get back down.
 There is a large coil of rope here.
 A clear glass bottle is here.
 The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water
 A brown sack is here.
 The brown sack contains:
  A knife
  A clove of garlic

 Engravings Cave
 You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast.
 There are old engravings on the walls here.

 >x engravings
 The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately a later age seems to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.

 >se
 Riddle Room
 This is a room which is bare on all sides.  There is an exit down. To the east is a great door made of stone.  Above the stone, the following words are written: 'No man shall enter this room without solving this riddle:

                           WELCOME TO ZORK

     ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within!

     In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

     No PDP-10 should be without one!

     ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK was originally written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version was translated from MDL into Inform by Ethan Dicks <erd@infinet.com>.

 You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches.  The nearest branch above you is above your reach.

 In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird.  The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl.  Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a delicate looking clasp holding it closed.

         Intrepid Adventurer
         c/o Local Dungeon Master
         White House, GUE

 From the Introduction:

 The brochure describes, for the edification of the prospective student, the stringent but wide-ranging curriculum of MIT Tech. Required courses are offered in Ambition, Distraction, Uglification and Derision.  The Humanities are not slighted in this institution, as the student may register for Reeling and Writhing, Mystery (Ancient and Modern), Seaography, and Drawling (which includes Stretching and Fainting in Coils).  Advanced students are expected to learn Laughing and Grief.

                                 William Barton Flathead, Fovnder

 (The brochure continues in this vein for a few hundred more pages.)

                           WELCOME TO ZORK

     ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within!

     In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

     No PDP-10 should be without one!

     ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK was originally written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version was translated from MDL into Inform by Ethan Dicks <erd@infinet.com>.

     On-line information may be available using the HELP and INFO commands (most systems).

 Studio
 This is what appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace; although you might be able to get up it, it seems unlikely you could get back down.
 There is an ivory torch here.
 A brown sack is here.
 The brown sack contains:
  A clove of garlic
 A clear glass bottle is here.
 The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water
 There is a coil of thin shiny wire here.
 There is a nasty-looking knife lying here.
 There is a brass lantern (battery-powered) here.

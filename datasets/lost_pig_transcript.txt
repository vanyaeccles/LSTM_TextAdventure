>go west
Grunk not allowed in field. That probably OK, because Grunk not think pig tall enough to climb over wall.

>x wall
Wall made of many big rock. It not very tall; Grunk lots taller than wall. Maybe it too hard, find enough big rock to make big wall. There field on other side of wall.

>go north
Forest look dark. Pig probably some place in there, but Grunk not know which way to go. Not want end up lost in forest with no pig.

>i
Grunk have:
  torch (on fire)
  pants (Grunk wearing them)

>hold torch
Grunk already have that!

>use torch on forest
Grunk not know what that mean.

>burn forest
(with torch)
That maybe dangerous. But then if forest all burned up, pig not have any place to hide, so maybe it really good idea. Grunk not sure. That really what Grunk should do?

>yes
Grunk hold torch up to tree. Tree start to burn. Then other tree start to burn. And other tree. And other tree. Then Grunk hear pig squeal! Pig run out of forest, and it not even see Grunk until after Grunk grab it. Silly pig!

Ha ha. Grunk smart, catch pig. Grunk get to go back to farm now. Maybe boss say that Grunk do good job. Fire go toward farm, too. There lots of tree to burn. Fire go even faster than Grunk.

Uh oh. There lots of tree near farm, too. Fire get there before Grunk. Farm burn like tree. Grunk think that maybe boss not say Grunk do good job, if boss find out that Grunk make fire. Maybe it better if Grunk not go back to farm after all.

Oh well. At least Grunk get to keep tasty pig.

    *** Grunk not bring pig back to farm ***

Grunk have 0 out of 7 that time.

Time for Grunk to RESTART or RESTORE a saved story or UNDO what Grunk just do or tell FULL score or just QUIT?

Outside
[OK, Grunk undo that.]

>go east
Forest look dark. Pig probably some place in there, but Grunk not know which way to go. Not want end up lost in forest with no pig.

When Grunk really quiet, try looking around some more. There, hear noise again! It come from northeast. Must be pig, hiding in bushes.

[Grunk score go up one.]

>ne
If that where pig go, that where Grunk go. It hard to see where Grunk going to, because there so much dark and leaves and branches here. Then suddenly, there not ground here any more!

Oof! Ow! Umf! Ugh!

Grunk fall down deep hole! Drop torch. Torch go out when Grunk land on it, so now it dark, too.

Hole
Grunk at bottom of deep, dark hole. It even smell like deep, dark hole. There some light that come from tunnel to east; that how Grunk see where Grunk at. Look like there maybe stairs at west side of hole that go up to outside, but them all broken now. There big crack in ground near stairs, too.

Grunk see torch (black and sooty) here.

>get torch
OK, got it.

>x crack
Crack wide as Grunk fist, at least at top. It dark, so Grunk not see if anything there inside or how deep crack go.

Room light up! Grunk see little bed and trunk and desk and little man in bed. Light come from blue ball that sit on desk. Little man climb out of bed and put on pair of pointy slipper. Him walk over and squint at Grunk. “Huh,” him say. “An orc.”

“Well, Grunk,” him say, “What do you want?”

>ask gnome about torch
Grunk tell gnome all about torch that Grunk bring.

Gnome say, “It’s always a good idea to bring a light source along when you go exploring. It’s a shame yours has gone out. If only you had some means of making a fire.”

“There are many different ways to make fire,” Gnome say. “You can use flint and steel, if you have them. They say you can rub two pieces of wood together, but I’ve never had much luck with that.” Then gnome say, “Or you could just use alchemy. But whichever you use, be careful not to make a mess with all that soot and ash.”

Gnome go over to trunk and open it up. Him start searching in there.

Gnome say, “This is a shrine dedicated to a gnomish alchemist who became slightly famous a number of years ago for coming up with a few random inventions.”

Gnome sigh. “Well, it’s gone. I can’t find my copy of Mogglev’s The Shocking Force anywhere.”

Gnome go back to desk and sit down.

“I don’t even know how long it’s been missing,” him say. “It’s probably in the hands of that last band of looters now.”

Gnome open book up and start reading it.

“Hey!” Uh oh, gnome look mad. Him shout at Grunk, “Did you rip a page out of here?”

Grunk not rip any thing out of any other thing at all today! And Grunk tell gnome that, too.

“No.” Gnome sigh. “I suppose you couldn’t have. This is proof paper, after all. You’d need to cut it out with a knife.” Then him put book down on desk. “But that’s what someone did, unfortunately. And it was an important page, as well.”

[Grunk score go down one.]

Then him pause. Maybe hoping Grunk ask what. So Grunk ask what.

Gnome say, “I’m creating a device that is actually able to augment nothing less than thought itself!”

Then him pause again. Grunk not know what gnome hoping Grunk ask now, so Grunk just wait.

After gnome and Grunk both wait for little bit, gnome say. “It’s a big ambition. My first model is only able to perform simple arithmetic. But the next one I’m designing should be able to handle logarithms. After it understands basic mathematics, who knows what this ‘thinking cap’ could be programmed to do?”

Gnome open up little box. It full of lots of little metal thing with different shape. Look like them some kind of tool.

This is a story by Grunk. It’s about something that happened to him before he joined the army. We’re not quite sure how much of it is true, and how much is just a product of his imagination. We suspect Grunk may not be sure either.

It should be impossible to get the story into an unwinnable state. It is possible to end it prematurely, but you should always be able to safely UNDO.

Lost Pig was written as an entry for the 2007 Interactive Fiction Competition.

[SPACE.]

Conversation in this game is topic-based. You can ASK, TELL, or TALK TO characters about different things Grunk has seen or heard about during the course of the story. For your typing convenience, any of these three commands can be shortened to T <TOPIC>, provided Grunk knows whom he should be addressing his concerns to at the moment.

When you’re returning to a place you’ve visited before, you can use the GO TO command to attempt to go there directly. Likewise, this can also be used to locate characters who are currently in places you’re already familiar with.

[SPACE.]

Everyone has their own preferences, but sometimes it can be more fun and more satisfying to solve a puzzle on your own without outside help. Are you sure you want to look at the hints right now?

Hey, Grunk outside again! Yay! It still night time, but Grunk have light, so that OK. This look like it near place Grunk at before. Farm not far at all from here. Just little way to southwest.

Gnome here, waiting for Grunk.

Gnome take trunk back from Grunk. “I think this is where we part ways,” him say. “You can probably find your way back to the farm from here.” Gnome shake Grunk hand. Then gnome say, “Remember the name Zugilbor Galrogginpots sem Endali dec Frebensalbibit. This won’t be the last time you hear it.”

Then gnome go one way and Grunk go other way. It not long before Grunk back at farm. Boss already sleeping, so Grunk put pig back quiet and go to bed. Tomorrow, maybe boss proud of Grunk.

>talk to hacker
Hmmm … the hacker waits for you to say something.

>hacker, hi
“Greetingage.” He turns back to his hacking.

>ask hacker about hacking
I don’t know the word “hacking.”

>examine pc
This is a beyond-state-of-the-art personal computer. It has a 1024 by 1024 pixel color monitor, a mouse, an attached hard disk, and a local area network connection. Fortunately, one of its features is a prominent HELP key. It is currently turned off.

>turn on pc
The computer powers up, goes through a remarkably fast self-check, and greets you, requesting “LOGIN PLEASE:”. The only sound you hear is a very low hum.

>login
What do you want to login?

>log in to computer
I don’t know the word “log.”

>type username
The computer responds “PASSWORD PLEASE:”

>type password
What do you want to type passwo?

>ask hacker about password
There seems to be a noun missing in that sentence.

>type 872325412
The computer responds “INVALID LOGIN” and then “LOGIN PLEASE:”.

>type 872325412
The computer responds “PASSWORD PLEASE:”

>type uhlersoth
The computer responds “Good evening. You’re here awfully late.” It displays a list of pending tasks, one of which is in blinking red letters, with large arrows pointing to it. The task reads “Classics Paper,” some particularly ominous words next to it say “DUE TOMORROW!” and more reassuringly, a menu box next to that reads “Edit Classics Paper.”

>edit classics paper
The menu box is replaced by the YAK text editor and menu boxes listing the titles of your files. The one for your paper is highlighted in a rather urgent-looking shade of red.

>press help key
You push the friendly-looking HELP key. A spritely little box appears on the screen, which reads: “Please click the box representing the file you wish to edit or view. I notice that one file is marked as urgent, so you should probably click its box.”

>click urgent box
You click the box for your paper, and the box grows reassuringly until it fills most of the screen. Unfortunately, the text that fills it bears no resemblance to your paper. The title is the same, but after that, there is something different, very different.

>read paper
The paper appears to be a facsimile overlaid with occasional typescript. The text is mostly in a sort of “Olde English” you’ve never seen before. What you read is a combination of incomprehensible gibberish, latinate pseudowords, debased Hebrew and Arabic scripts, and an occasional disquieting phrase in English.

As you look at it more closely, you find it hard to focus on the screen, but impossible to look away. Your finger strays toward the “MORE” box…

>save
Okay.

>press more
You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.

The second page is much like the first, but around the edges, not when you look at it straight, it’s almost readable. There is something about a “summoning,” or a “visitor.”

>summon visitor
I don’t know the word “summon.”

>press more
You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.

The third page is in the same script as the first, but laid out like a poem. There are woodcut illustrations which are queasily disturbing.

There is a translation, or notes for one, typed between the lines of the poem:

“He returns, he is called back (?)
The loyal ones (acolytes?) make a sacrifice
Those who survive will meet him (be absorbed? eaten?)
They will live, yet die
Forever will be (is?) nothing to them (to him?)

“His place (lair? burrow?) must be prepared
His food (offerings?) must be prepared
Call him forth (invite him?) with great power
Only an acceptable (tasteful?) sacrifice will call him forth
He will be grateful (satiated?)”

The rest is even more fragmentary.

>press more
You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.

The fourth page is a photograph. You try to recoil from the screen, but cannot. Fascinated and repelled at the same time, you wonder: is that a mouth, and what is in it?

>examine photograph
I don’t know the word “photograph.”

>x photo
I don’t know the word “photo.”

>x page
Instead, you find your finger moving towards the MORE box, and you touch it. The screen feels oddly cold.

You faint, and when you awaken…

[Use $SOUND to toggle sound usage on and off.]

Place
This is a place. Things move about on a broken, rocky surface. Harsh sounds split the air. Something sticky grabs at your feet. There is no color, everything is drained of brightness, dull and lifeless. A path descends into a shallow bowl of black basalt.

>d
Basalt Bowl
You are at the bottom of a deeply cut, smooth basalt bowl. Dimly seen shapes crowd you on all sides. Ahead, in the focus of the movement, is a rock platform.

>forward
I don’t know the word “forward.”

>x shapes
I don’t know the word “shapes.”

>x platform
The platform is made of the same rocks as the surrounding terrain. In fact, you can’t tell whether it is natural or constructed.

The crowd around you begins to sway and groan. They are expecting something. You are drawn forward by the noise.

At Platform
You stand before a low rock platform, more like an afterthought of piled rocks or a glacial moraine than a work of artifice. You are pushed against the pile by the crowd around you.

One small stone stands out in the pile, smooth, shiny, and glowing with a blazing light.

>x stone
It’s a smooth, shiny piece of what might be obsidian. Scratched on it is a symbol.

>x symbol
The symbol, on close examination, appears to have been carved into the smooth stone, perhaps with a claw. The symbol is like nothing you’ve ever seen, and yet somehow you know it has meaning.

>take stone
Taken.

Suddenly, the dimness becomes darkness, and the crowd around you explodes with excitement. You are jostled and shoved from all sides. A low keening begins, building into a deafening, almost mechanical chant. The darkness before you compacts and deepens.

>eat stone
The food here is terrible, but this is ridiculous!

The darkness before you, now visible, is a creature. It towers over the now-silent crowd. The thing jerks this way and that, spraying a foul ichor. Its palps twitch expectantly, then pound impatiently against the rock. You can feel the smooth stone vibrating in your hand.

>show stone to creature
The thing is uninterested.

The thing now turns, sensing the presence of the stone. It quests almost blindly for it, then those surrounding you thrust you forward. The thing stoops, its mandibles grasping you. You are lifted towards its gaping maw. The stench and the sounds issuing from it are overwhelming, and you fall unconscious.

You are awakened by the thump of your head hitting the terminal in front of you. Falling asleep over term papers! It must have been a nightmare. Embarrassed, you glance around. Yes, the hacker is looking in your direction. He must have heard the thump.

Terminal Room, on the chair

A really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.

Sitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.

>i
You are carrying a smooth stone and an assignment.

The hacker wanders over, trying to look nonchalant as he takes over your chair. “Losing, huh?” he asks wittily. He glances at your terminal, which displays a pattern of snow and unusual characters. He appears somewhat excited.

>x terminal
This is a beyond-state-of-the-art personal computer. It has a 1024 by 1024 pixel color monitor, a mouse, an attached hard disk, and a local area network connection. Fortunately, one of its features is a prominent HELP key. On the screen you see a menu box.

The hacker, mumbling under his breath, begins a flurry of activity. First the screen returns to something nearly normal, then windows begin popping up like toadstools after a rain. The screen looks a lot like the top of his terminal table (or the bottom of a trash can).

>read assignment
Laser printed on creamy bond paper, the assignment is due tomorrow. It’s from your freshman course in “The Classics in the Modern Idiom,” better known as “21.014.” It reads, in part: “Twenty pages on modern analogues of Xenophon’s ‘Anabasis.'” You’re not sure whether this refers to the movie “The Warriors” or “Alien,” but this is the last assignment you need to complete in this course this term. You wonder, yet again, why a technical school requires you to endure this sort of stuff.

The hacker types furiously, and the screen displays what to you looks like an explosion in a teletype factory. After a while he says. “Chomping file system. Your directory has gone seriously west. I fixed it.” He checks the screen. “It was mixed up on the file server with some files from the Department of Alchemy.” He grunts. “People’s names for their nodes are getting weird. This one is called ‘Lovecraft.'” He pauses. “Your paper is gone, though. Sorry. Maybe they could help you down there.”

>cry
I don’t know the word “cry.”

>x hacker
The hacker is sitting at your terminal, typing furiously. Every so often, he pauses briefly and twirls a lock of his hair. He is also humming under his breath. The hacker is dressed in blue jeans, an old work shirt, and what might once have been running shoes. Hanging from his belt is an enormous ring of keys. He is in need of a bath.

The hacker wanders back to his terminal and returns to his hacking.

>show stone to hacker
“Odd-looking thing. Are you a rock-jock?”

>take keys
“Hey! No snarfage, loser!” You determine that this means, “Stop!”

>ask hacker about keys
“I’ve accumulated a few keys over the years. I’m a licensed locksmith, which helps. I can get into any room at Tech.” He pulls the keyring out on its chain, and shows off a key you hadn’t noticed before. “This is a master key,” he says.

>ask hacker for master key
“Fat chance! This is a master key! What have you done for me lately?”

>save
Okay.

>punch hacker
I don’t know the word “punch.”

>ask hacker about department of alchemy
You can’t see any department of alchemy here.

The hacker turns to you and says, “I don’t know where I can get something to eat, what with all the snow.”

>feed hacker

You aren’t holding the hacker.

>feed assignment to hacker
“No thanks, keep it for now.”

In the center of the floor you can see a large, flat slab of granite. The only exit is behind you to the south.

>x slab
The slab is roughly circular, made of indifferently dressed New England granite, and about three feet high.

>open slab

>lay on slab
You aren’t holding the slab of granite.

>stand on slab
That would be a waste of time.

Before the Altar
You are at the bottom of the cave. The huge slab of granite in the center is a sort of altar. It is carved with strange and disturbing symbols, the largest of which looks very familiar. Some of the symbols are obscured by rusty red stains. Nearby is an iron plate set in the concrete of the floor.

Lying to one side of the altar stone is a sharp, thin-bladed knife.

>x knife
This small knife is clean, sharp, and has a long, thin blade and a wooden handle. Only the tip of the blade appears at all dull or used.

>take knife
Taken.

>x tip
I don’t know the word “tip.”

>x symbols
Which symbols do you mean, the incised symbol or the carved symbol?

>incised
The symbol appears to be the oldest thing carved on the altar. It is beautifully incised in the rocks. Its age is apparent from its wear and the overlay of newer carvings and scratchings over it. The symbol looks oddly familiar.

>put stone on altar
Done.

>x carved symbol
The symbol, on close examination, appears to have been carved into the smooth stone, perhaps with a claw. The symbol seems just as odd as before.

>x grate
I don’t know the word “grate.”

>x plate
The plate is iron, about two feet square, and looks like it could be slid open. A curious feature of the plate is that it has upward projecting dents in it which appear to have been punched from below.

>save

Ancient Storage
What’s deader than dead storage? That’s what’s in this room. Most of the contents have collapsed or rusted back to the primordial ooze. There is mold growing on some of the unidentifiable piles. Stagnant puddles of water pollute the floor. You can now believe how old some of these foundations are said to be.

In one corner of the room a manhole cover is partly buried in the dirt and crud.

There is an open manhole here.

Dead Storage
This is a storage room. It contains an incredible assemblage of discarded junk. Some of it is so old and mouldering that you can’t be sure where one bit of junk stops and the next begins. It’s piled to the ceiling on ancient, rotting pallets. A narrow path winds eastward through the junk.

>w
Temporary Basement
During the Second World War, some temporary buildings were built to house war-related research. Naturally, these buildings, though flimsy and ugly, are still around. This is the basement of one of them. The basement extends west, a stairway leads up, and a large passage is to the east.

Slouching nearby is an urchin.

>show funny bones to urchin

>x parka
It bulges in odd places.

The urchin looks around nervously, obviously thinking of flight, but decides against it.

>x bulges
I don’t know the word “bulges.”

>u
Temporary Lab
This is a laboratory of some sort. It takes up most of the building on this level, all the interior walls having been knocked down. (One reason these temporary buildings are still here is their flexibility: no one cares if they get more or less destroyed.) A stairway leads down, and a door leads north.

There is a metal flask here.

>x flask
This is a large metal flask, about the size of a water cooler bottle. The metal flask is closed.

>open flask
You open the flask, and a cold, white mist boils out.

>close flask
You screw the flask closed.

>take flask
Taken.

The mist dissipates.

You enter the freezing, biting cold of the blizzard.

Smith Street
Smith Street runs west towards the computer center here. To the south is a dilapidated grey wooden building. The street is an impassable sea of blowing and drifting snow.

>w
Smith Street
Smith Street runs east and west along the north side of the main campus area. At the moment, it is an arctic wasteland of howling wind and drifting snow. On the other side of the street, barely visible, are the lidless eyes of streetlights. The street hasn’t been plowed, or if it has been, it did no good.

Bitter, bone-cracking cold assaults you continuously. The temperature and the blizzard conditions are both horrible.

>w
Impenetrable snow drifts block the street.

You push your way into the welcoming warmth inside.

This is the lobby of the Computer Center. An elevator and call buttons are to the south. Stairs also lead up and down, for the energetic. To the north is Smith Street.

Basement
Bare concrete walls line a wide corridor leading east and west. An elevator and call button are to the south. Stairs also lead up, for the energetic. From floor to ceiling run wire channels and steam pipes.

You are beginning to tire.

The urchin saunters nonchalantly into the room, notices you, and beats a hasty retreat.

>turn off flashlight
The flashlight clicks off.

Tomb
This is a tiny, narrow, ill-fitting room. It appears to have been a left over space from the joining of two preexisting buildings. It is roughly coffin shaped. The walls are covered by decades of overlaid graffiti, but there is one which is painted in huge fluorescent letters that were apparently impossible for later artists to completely deface. On the floor is a rusty access hatch locked with a huge padlock.

>read letters
It reads “The Tomb of the Unknown Tool.”

>unlock padlock with key
The lock, though rusty and unwilling, opens, releasing the hatch.

>open hatch
The hatch is heavy, and its hinges are rusty, but you pull and strain and it opens with a scream of metal. Revealed below is a rusty ladder leading down. Warm, fetid air coils up out of the hole. There is a burned out (no, smashed) utility light set in the wall a few feet down.

>turn on flashlight
The flashlight clicks on.

>d
Steam Tunnel
This dank and grimy tunnel is largely filled with an imperfectly insulated steam pipe. The tunnel is uncomfortably hot and damp. You have gone from the arctic to the tropics. The concrete tunnel has odd molds and fungi growing on its walls and ceiling, and the floor is squishy. Torn clots of insulation litter the floor. Along the ceiling runs a thick tangle of coaxial cable. The tunnel heads east and west. A rusty metal ladder leads up.

You can hear, in the distance, a chittering, scratching sound.

>save
Okay.

>listen
You hear the chittering of rats.

The sound is louder. It sounds like small animals. Is it rats?

>yes
That was a rhetorical question.

The sound continues. It’s almost certainly rats.

Steam Tunnel
This dank and grimy tunnel is largely filled with an imperfectly insulated steam pipe. The tunnel is uncomfortably hot and damp. A thick bundle of coaxial cable runs east to west along the ceiling. There is a pressure release valve on the steam pipe here.

>x valve
It looks pretty rusty, but appears to be in working order. It’s closed.

The rat sounds are growing louder, but you still can’t see any rats.

>open valve
It’s too rusty. You pull and strain, but nothing happens.

A troop of rats appears out of the darkness. The rats are momentarily startled by your presence, but soon the bolder ones begin to approach. There are more rats here than you have ever seen.

>open valve with crowbar
The valve, with a horrible scream of tortured metal, gives a little, and a small trickle of steam issues forth. This further agitates the rats.

The rats attack! Slimy, snarling, and hungry, they swarm over your feet, biting at your legs and clinging desperately to your feet.

>again
The valve screeches open. A jet spray of live steam issues from it, filling the tunnel in front of you. The rats are caught in the full force of the blast. Horrible squeals can be heard from the midst of the steam cloud, and scalded rats charge past you, all interest in anything but flight forgotten. One of their number remains, dead.

>take dead rat
As you take the dead rat, it moves, but then you realize that it’s only lice and fleas bailing out.

>close valve with crowbar
The valve closes, more easily than it opened.

>x rat
This rat appears to have been stepped on. A small trickle of blood has clotted around its mouth. Branded into its neck is a strange symbol.

>x symbol
The symbol, on close examination, appears to have been scarred into the hide of the rat. There is no hair growing on it, and although it looks like scar tissue, the color is wrong — a sort of purplish green. The symbol looks oddly familiar.

>compare scarred symbol to carved symbol
I don’t know the word “scarred.”

Steam Tunnel
This dank and grimy tunnel is largely filled with an imperfectly insulated steam pipe. The tunnel is uncomfortably hot and damp. A thick bundle of coaxial cable runs east to west along the ceiling. There is a pressure release valve on the steam pipe here.

>x cable
The cable runs overhead in a fat bundle. It looks like the kind you’ve seen connecting nodes of the local net. This clump is pretty grotty looking, festooned with damp cobwebs, and stained with something that dripped from the ceiling.

The steam pipe and coaxial cable turn upwards and disappear into the ceiling here. The tunnel itself comes to an end in a grimy, damp, and dripping triad of crumbling brick walls. The south wall looks particularly decrepit.

>break wall with crowbar
It doesn’t do much but loosen a brick in the wall.

>g
It doesn’t do much but loosen a brick in the wall.

It’s a new brick. It appears to be of relatively recent vintage.

>x broken brick

new brick: You can’t get a good grip on the new brick with your fingers.

>press new brick
Pushing the new brick has no effect.

>pry new brick with crowbar
The wall grudgingly yields to your efforts. A brick, less well mortared than its fellows, drops to the floor on the other side, making a hole through the wall. You can see a rusty steel reinforcing rod in the hole.

>x rod
It’s rusty, obviously didn’t help the wall all that much, and runs up and down through the hole you have made.

>look through hole
There is an open space, a small room containing some machinery. You can’t see too well, though.

This is a wide spot in the tunnel, just as wet and muddy as elsewhere. The walls are slimy as well. Numerous slots or indentations about two feet wide and a foot high open here and there. Thin, wire or ropelike growths emerge from a hole further down and enter each of the slots. There is background noise here, almost loud enough to hear clearly.

A small, furtive motion attracts your attention to the slots.

>x slots
The slots are narrow burrows apparently dug by hand out of the mud of the chamber walls. Most of the slots have a thin wire or rope heading into them. You begin to be quite certain that there is something moving inside the slot you are looking at.

There is motion in the slots. In fact, there is motion in almost all of them.

>listen
The noise, as you listen more carefully, resolves itself into voices. They are chanting, but the words are unknown to you.

Slowly, painfully, things emerge from the slots. They are pale, thin creatures with red mouths and staring eyes. Mold grows in their hair and wirelike streamers wrap their heads and join a bundle on the floor. You realize that these are urchins.

>cut wire with knife
The knife drives the wire into the mud, but doesn’t cut it.

>x urchins
These are not normal looking urchins. Their clothes are muddy and tattered. They are barefoot in midwinter, and covered with mud. Around their heads are draped the ropy growths that you’ve been noticing in this area. Although their eyes are open, they stare catatonically.

The knife is pushed contemptuously aside, barely slowing his advance.

The maintenance man continues slipping, falling, standing, and so on. He reminds you of a badly made windup toy.

Department of Alchemy
This office is clinically clean, shiny, and modern. It looks like something out of a science fiction movie. A closed door to the north leads back into the corridor and an archway opens to the south.

Taped to the wall to the right of the archway is a sign-up sheet.

The professor is here.

>read sheet
This appears to be a sign-up sheet for the lab. Strangely, although few daytime segments are used, almost all of the nighttime ones are. Most seem to have been taken by two different people, the professor and another, presumably one of his graduate students. The name of the graduate student is oddly familiar.

The professor gazes at you in a bored and distracted way.

Skyscraper Roof
A low parapet surrounds a small roof here. The air conditioning cooling tower and the small protrusion containing the stairs are dwarfed by a semitransparent dome which towers above you. The blowing snow obscures all detail of the city across the river to the south.

>x dome
The dome is large and semitransparent. It’s made of some sort of milky-colored plastic. It dominates the roof. You can climb up to the entrance via a short ladder.

Bitter, bone-cracking cold assaults you continuously. The temperature and the blizzard conditions are both horrible.

You push your way into the welcoming warmth inside.

Inside Dome
You are inside a large domed area. The dome contains equipment that makes it clear it is a weather observation station. For some reason, it also contains a small peach tree. Wind whistles outside, and snow blasts against the semitransparent material of the dome.

>x tree
It’s a small peach tree planted in a very large tub of earth. It appears healthy, although as it is wintertime, the tree has no leaves.

>x dirt
The tub is full of dirt and “condo chips” (those pine bark chips that are spread around condos and shopping centers by the ton). The dirt has been disturbed recently.

>dig
What do you want to dig in?

>dig in dirt
You root around in the dirt for a while, when you encounter something hard. Further exploration reveals it to be a dried, chewed looking human hand.

>x hand
The hand is very old. It’s dry and very light, mummified in fact. There are stains, scars, and dried blood on it. There is a tattoo on the back of it. The hand appears to have been severed by the application of very sharp teeth, perhaps an animal’s.

>x tattoo
The tattoo is old and faded. It was done in red ink and is very artistically drawn. The symbol looks oddly familiar.

Something smashes against the glass of the dome! You turn and see a dark shape clinging to the outside of the structure.

You are carrying a human hand, a plastic container, a knife, a crowbar, a master key, a two liter bottle of Classic Coke and a flashlight. You are wearing a pair of rubber boots and a pair of electrician’s gloves.

The creature enters the dome, screaming viciously at you, its claws reaching out to grasp and rend.

>hit creature with crowbar
Hissing and screeching, the creature fends off your attack. Its head jerks from side to side, watching you.

In a snake-like strike, the creature attacks! Its toothy jaws close on your hand! Not your hand, but the mummified hand you dug out of the tub! With a disgusting gobbling noise, the flier swallows the hand, and then, using its wings to push itself away, it scuttles out into the cold and away.

Great Dome
Here a walkway circles the base of a huge ornate dome. Below is the Infinite Corridor. From stories of Tech Exploring trips, you recall that there is supposed to be a ladder here. On the other hand, there is a shiny rope-like thing hanging near where the ladder used to be, and leading upward.

>x rope
The strand is wet and glistening. It extends upward into the dome, leading to a narrow catwalk.

>up
There is no stairway.

>climb rope
The wet stuff on the strand sticks to the gloves, but doesn’t otherwise affect you. You have a little trouble climbing up to the catwalk, but grab the rail just before your strength gives out. You heave yourself up onto the catwalk.

You stand up on the catwalk, catching your breath for a moment. Your eyes stray along the strand you climbed. It trails along the catwalk, where it joins something large and squishy squatting at the far side. A single, bright-blue eye opens in the squishy mass, and the tentacle (for that’s what it is) retracts. The mass almost flows through the spaces in the catwalk railing and drops to the floor fifteen feet below. Before you can react, it’s gone.

Top of Dome
Inside the great dome, near the top, a metal catwalk is precariously perched. There is no way further up, but a small metal door is set in the side of the dome.

Where the pulpy mass was squatting, a wooden ladder lies on the catwalk.

>lower ladder

This is the very top of the Great Dome, a favorite place for Tech fraternities to install cows, Volkswagen Beetles, giant birthday candles, and other bizarre objects. The top is flat, round, and about five feet in diameter. It’s very windy, which has kept the snow from accumulating here. The only way off is down.

In the exact center of the flat area is a bronze plug.

Bitter, bone-cracking cold assaults you continuously. The temperature and the blizzard conditions are both horrible.

>x plug
This is a cylindrical bronze plug about two inches in diameter. It is set in the center of the flat part of the dome.

You pry the plug out of its socket, revealing a cylindrical hole about the same diameter but somewhat deeper. There is a piece of paper in the hole.

>get paper

You are feeling tired.

>read it
You unroll the piece of paper and read the shaky handwriting:

“I can no longer face what I’ve been doing. I can’t sleep, I start at the slightest noise, and even dulling my senses with alcohol or drugs is no longer enough. I refuse to participate in what he is doing any more. Either he is insane, or I am insane, or (and this is what I fear most) the universe itself is insane. I have only one final warning: I am the only suicide, but I will not be the final death.”

The name signed to it is that of the Alchemy Department graduate student.

“Ah! You’d like to see the lab?” the professor asks in a rather unctuous tone. “Come right in!” He ushers you through the archway into the lab, following quickly behind you and turning on the lights.

Lab
The lab is an ultramodern, fully equipped chemistry lab. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, you aren’t a chemistry major, so the equipment might as well be magical.

The professor is here.

There is a lab bench and an Alchemy Department computer here. Sitting on the lab bench is a vat. The vat contains a tarry liquid.

The professor guides you to the center of the lab, where a strange pentagonal symbol is chalked on the floor. He cuts one of the chalk lines with a small knife you had not previously noticed, pushes you into the center of the chalked symbol, and redraws the line, muttering softly and rhythmically as he does so. “There, that’s done. Don’t move from there, it’ll only make things worse for you.” He makes some odd gestures at the archway and then goes over to the lab bench.

>save
Okay.

>cut chalk line with knife
You cut the outer lines of the pentagram. It no longer completely encloses you. The professor sees what you’ve done out of the corner of his eye. He quickly slides over and redraws the pentagram. This time he performs a thorough search, removing all your possessions, tut-tutting all the while.

The professor is preparing something at the lab bench. “Alchemy is my chosen field, and I’ve gotten ridiculed for it. It’s like chemistry, except that chemists don’t recognize that some natural laws are enforced by persons, not physics. Some of them will grant power, or knowledge, but they must be placated, or even bribed. They’re not of this earth, not demons or devils, and they aren’t always friendly. To me it’s just an unpleasant necessity on the path to power. When I’m done, they won’t laugh anymore!”

You are empty-handed.

The professor enters another pentagram, and begins a highly choreographed ritual. “This may seem a little silly to you, but the symbology is what’s important. Certain alignments, certain aspects. In a few moments, it won’t matter anyway,” he remarks. “There is very little room for error here, so be calm.” He chants, he brandishes strange instruments, moves about inside the pentagram, and occasionally points to you. It becomes clear exactly what he meant by the word “bribe.”

>exit pentagram
Your feet approach the chalk line, and then stop. You can’t push your way out.

The chant grows more complex, with rhythms and cadences that make you want to stop your ears. The room appears to be getting darker.

>yell
The scream echoes back to you, subtly changed.

A thick black mist begins to form in the room. Parts are darker, and parts lighter, and the dark parts form a disturbing shape. The professor chants and calls more loudly now, and you realize the calls are being answered.

>x lab
You see nothing special about the laboratory.

The room is now freezing cold, though the windows are shuttered and tightly curtained. Low, bone-rattling vibrations shake the room in cadence with the chant. The black mist is growing thicker. The professor chants more rapidly, producing strange guttural sounds, scarcely human.

You are getting more and more tired.

>sleep
You’ve been up for a long time, and it was turning into an all-nighter. You can use the rest. You stretch out as best you can. You toss and turn fitfully, sleeping only in snatches.

You dream of standing on the roof of the Brown Building, looking down at the ground. You lose your balance…

Your dream ends, and another begins. Something clawed and fanged grabs you, and you try to wake, but you already are!

    **** You have died ****

At first, you think “Maybe it was all just a bad dream,” but no such luck. It appears to be for real. That’s too bad, although something gnawing on your toes thinks it’s pretty wonderful, or at least fairly tasty.

Your score is 50 of a possible 100, in 475 moves. Graded on the curve, you are in the class of Post-doc Student.

Would you like to restart the game from the beginning, restore a saved game position, or end this session of the game?

The professor is preparing something at the lab bench. “Alchemy is my chosen field, and I’ve gotten ridiculed for it. It’s like chemistry, except that chemists don’t recognize that some natural laws are enforced by persons, not physics. Some of them will grant power, or knowledge, but they must be placated, or even bribed. They’re not of this earth, not demons or devils, and they aren’t always friendly.

You are carrying a bronze plug, a fire axe, a plastic container, a knife, a crowbar, a master key, a two liter bottle of Classic Coke and a flashlight. You are wearing a pair of rubber boots and a pair of electrician’s gloves.

The professor enters another pentagram, and begins a highly choreographed ritual. “This may seem a little silly to you, but the symbology is what’s important. Certain alignments, certain aspects.

It becomes clear exactly what he meant by the word “bribe.”

>cut pentagram with knife
You cut the outer lines of the pentagram. It no longer completely encloses you. The professor sees what you’ve done out of the corner of his eye. He stares, horrified. “Stop, don’t move!” he says between verses of the chant. The chant takes on a pleading tone.

The chant grows more complex, the professor having difficulty with the almost unpronounceable words, with rhythms and cadences that make you want to stop your ears. The room appears to be getting darker.

>exit pentagram
You push your way through a soft spot just over the scuff marks, and are outside the pentagram. The air is thick and close.

A thick black mist begins to form in the room. Parts are darker, and parts lighter, and the dark parts form a disturbing shape. The professor chants and calls more loudly now, clearly terrified of what may happen, and you realize the calls are being answered.

>save
Okay.

>wait
Time passes…

The room is now freezing cold, though the windows are shuttered and tightly curtained. Low, bone-rattling vibrations shake the room in cadence with the chant. The black mist is growing thicker. The professor is alternately looking at you and at the mist.

You are getting more and more tired.

>g
Time passes…

The black mist swirls wildly around the room, and a deep bass voice gibbers out of thin air. “No!” screams the professor, and jumps toward you out of his own pentagram. He realizes what he has done, and tries to reenter, but the mist grabs at him.

>w
You can’t go that way.

A thing like a tentacle with a demonic face wraps slowly around you. The room recedes into a great distance as you are pulled away. Before you die, you see what the tentacle is a part of.

    **** You have died ****

At first, you think “Maybe it was all just a bad dream,” but no such luck. It appears to be for real. That’s too bad, although something gnawing on your fingertips thinks it’s pretty wonderful, or at least fairly tasty.

Not likely!

You get into the pentagram, being careful not to further scuff the chalk.

>x bench
The bench is a chemistry lab bench. It has a marble top, and casters at each corner. Various equipment litters the bench, none of which you recognize, but the lab bench also contains a vat.

This is a large (a couple of liters, at least) glass or pyrex vat. It has a label stuck to it. The vat contains a tarry liquid.

Which label do you mean, the vat or the plastic container?

The text is a long chemical-sounding name typed on a label affixed to the container. Below is written in pencil “Elixir of Life.”

Cinderblock Tunnel
This is a tunnel whose walls are cinderblock, with a concrete floor and ceiling. A metal ladder leads up to an open metal plate in the ceiling, and the tunnel continues north, where the cinderblock walls become brick.

From above, you hear a thunderous noise, a maniacal scream, and then the sound of equipment smashing. The trapdoor slams shut, but around it pours a blinding flash of light. Finally you hear an almost inaudible whimper, then nothing. The light fades, leaving you in the dark.

>save
Okay.

Lab
The lab is a shambles. It looks like something red and sticky has been spread over the walls, ceiling, and floor. Much of the equipment, particularly that near the center of the room, has been destroyed. There is an open metal plate in the floor.

There is a brass hyrax, a smooth stone, a piece of paper, a lab bench and an Alchemy Department computer here. Sitting on the lab bench is a vat. The vat contains a tarry liquid.

It fits surprisingly well.

You put on the gloves. They’re a little big, but not really such a bad fit at all.

Department of Alchemy
This office is clinically clean, shiny, and modern. It looks like something out of a science fiction movie. A closed door to the north leads back into the corridor and an archway opens to the south.

Taped to the wall to the right of the archway is a sign-up sheet.

The Alchemy Department door is closed.

Okay, the Alchemy Department door is now open.

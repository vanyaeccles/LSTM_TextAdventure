>look
You wrench your eyes open. Rough grey stone. Grey stone ceiling. Your head hurts, and --
You're lying on the floor. You're staring at the ceiling, and it's rough and grey, and you don't
recognize it.
You roll slowly (smooth cold floor?) and try to sit up. It hurts. You crawl upright. The walls, rough
stone also, scrape your aching fingers. You can't -- there was white agony, felt like raw light
tearing you apart. You can't remember anything after that.
You can't remember anything before that. Gone. You clutch at memory, and there's nothing but
empty air.
Cell
This space, barely wider than outstretched arms, seems to have been chopped raw and square
from unfinished stone. Only the floor is smooth -- a fine white surface beneath your feet. There
is a narrow gap in the east wall.

>help
This tutorial has lots of built-in help on how to play text adventures. To read more, type "help"
followed by whatever it is you want to get help on, and then hit enter. For example, you can type
"help basics" to see the most important IF commands.
>help basics
These are the commands you will use most often.
"look" or "l": Look around the room -- repeat the description of everything you see.
"examine thing" or "x thing": Look more closely at something -- learn more about it.
"inventory" or "i": List everything you're carrying.
"north", "south", "east", "west", etc., or "n", "s", "e", "w", etc.: Walk in some direction.
For more about these commands -- or any command used in this game -- type "help" followed
by the command word. For example, "help look". You might want to start by looking at the help
information for all of these basic commands.
For even more help topics and commands, just type "help".

from unfinished stone. Only the floor is smooth -- a fine white surface beneath your feet. There
is a narrow gap in the east wall.
>examine floor
The floor is also stone, but fine-grained and smooth -- not quite polished. It is very white; white
enough to show faint smudges where you lay.
>touch floor
Papery smooth, but cold and hard.
>walk east
You duck your head and push through the gap.
Narrow Hallway
You are standing in a short windowless hallway. To the east is the foot of a flight of stairs, which
rises out of sight. To the west, the hallway narrows, ending in a small gap of a doorway.
[Looks like you've taken the first step. Well done.
Let me introduce myself. I am the Voice of this tutorial. Most games don't have me; but in this
game, I will watch over your shoulder and give you some help. With a little practice, you'll soon
be moving around the text adventure world in style.
Back to the story. Remember what's going on? Actually, you don't. As the introduction said, you
can't remember who you are or what you're doing here!
Amnesia. Yes, it's a clichÃ©, but it'll do for a tutorial.
I'll let you go on exploring. The west corridor leads back to the cell where you started, so you'll
want to try up the stairs instead. Type "up" or "climb stairs".]
>up
You begin climbing the stairs. They seem to go on for a long while... pressing between dim
stone walls (where is the light coming from? You haven't seen a window yet)... climbing... (how
far?)...
Until you pass through a doorway into warm candlelight.
Crowded Study
You stand amid clutter, oddments, shelves and stacks. The chamber is comfortably broad,
centered around a massive and well-worn wooden desk. But so much is jammed in, around the
desk and up the panelled walls, that you barely find room to stand. Books; papers; dried plants;
animals stuffed and preserved, antique instruments, candles of any hue. You don't recognize
half of it, and you can't name half the rest.
There are wide doorways on the north and east sides of the room. A door of heavy wood stands
closed to the south, and stairs descend into dimness to the west.
You see an immense book on the desk. Behind the desk is a tall glass-fronted cabinet. Beside
that is a small brass trunk, which is closed.
If there were a quarter as much here, and a tenth as many books, you might be in any scholar's
study. But this knowledge must represent lifetimes of work -- lifetimes under a single hand. You
do not know where you are, but you know what this place is: a dreamhold. A wizard's high
house.
You do not find yourself afraid. A dreamhold is more than merely dangerous.
>examine clutter
You look helplessly about. You couldn't catalogue it all in a wizard's years.
Something in the chaos catches your eye. It looks like a white papier-mache mask, lying beside
the desk.
>take mask
Taken.
[Your score has gone up.
Your score is displayed in the top right corner of the window. "1 of 7" means you've achieved
one out of seven main goals. The score increased when you picked up the white mask; so
presumably there are seven masks to find in the game.
You can get a full account of your score by typing "score".]
>examine oddments
You look helplessly about. You couldn't catalogue it all in a wizard's years.
>examine shelves
Books are lined up on shelves, stacked on the floor, scattered in hazard across everything else
in the room. You glance at a few titles, gingerly lift a cover -- but you recognize none of the
many scripts and languages you find.
>take book
The immense book does not seem to want to move from its place on the desk.
>examine desk
The desk is heavy and plain, a massive wooden construction. Surprisingly, the surface is bare,
except for an immense book.
>touch desk
You feel nothing unexpected.
>touch book
You feel nothing unexpected.
>examine book
The book lies open. You frown at the fine, angular hand -- the same as enscribes every other
book in the room -- but discover that you can read it:
 The Theory & UNDERSTANDING of Portalls;
The lesser, which make a single place of many, and the Greater, which open from NOW into
Time in Memory, or Prophecy Foretold, or even a Moment's Fancy;
All portals are perilous. Perilous thresholds to cross, and more perilous to create; For there is no
plying of the World, or of Time, that does not happen in the Mind of the learned one who
conceives of the journey. Of your Thought is the portal built, arch and capstone. Slip but a
moment of your attention, and the Portal will fall into ruin; All its might, and yours, crumbled into
eggshell fragments that stray upon the Wind; ...
The facing page shows an elaborate circular diagram, annotated here and there with tiny
mathematical notes. The only comment you understand, tucked in a margin, says "Best to draw
in a well-insulated space -- 35 Ll. of uncut stone? -- move house to Emmen Valley, work into
mountain?"
>draw portal
You cannot envision that clearly enough to draw it.
>wear mask
The mask has no ribbons to tie -- it is not even curved to fit a human face. In any case, it's half
life-size. It cannot be worn.
Nonetheless, you try raising the mask before your eyes....
...Memory stirs...
A child runs through the forest. A robe, richly bright-embroidered, has slipped off one skinny
shoulder -- a child old enough to be put in clothes, too young to know what it means to wear
them. A silver-haired child whose glance darts from tree to bird, caught everywhere.
A mother's voice shouting. Not patient, not yet urgent. The child attends this, with the same
interest as bush, flower, fascinating new rustle underfoot...
The name, again.
A moist leaf, torn from a tree, clutched in a small fist. Tossed in the air. Blown about, blown
upwards again and again, as the child dances back and forth, face raised, flushed, puffing
madly...
Mother's voice interrupting the game. The child spins once more, dashes back towards dinner.
The leaf flutters about in the air. It circles a tree; then rises to a high branch, clings there. It
seems to bend this way and that; then it casts loose, and flutters determinedly after its
thoughtless maker.
You yank the mask away with a shudder. What are these memories? Do they belong to the
wizard whose house you are disturbing?

Strange, though. Some of the books are ancient, some are crumbling with wear, and some are
stiffly new. But every one seems to be written by the same hand.
>read new books
What do you want to read in?
>examine new books
You can't see any such thing.
>examine plants
Sprays of dried leaves, flowers, and seed pods poke out of various pots. Decoration, medicine,
research? You have no way to tell.
>examine trunk
A small square trunk is pushed up against the back wall, beside a tall cabinet. The trunk's
panels and lid are tarnished brass; they're engraved with worn geometric designs. The trunk sits
closed.
>open
What do you want to open?
>open trunk
You hesitate a moment. Prying into a wizard's possessions? But you're already standing in his
home; and you could as easily be damned for making free with his candlelight as with his trunk.
You reach out, flip up the brass lid, and step back in one movement... A copper key glints at the
very bottom of the trunk.
>take key
Taken.
>examine cabinet
The cabinet is a tall and ornate affair; its feet and edges are carved into flamboyant spirals. Two
broad and utterly flawless glass panes form the cabinet's front surface.
The cabinet's shelves are filled with curiosities. Tiny crystals and worn river stones, intricate
knots of wire and slabs of rough metal, scraps of folded paper and loops of colored string. A
small bell of rune-scratched glass. Three beans in a golden dish. A human hand, eye, and
heart, all seemingly carved of chalk. An amethyst scale, the length of your finger, which lies in a
pool of its own light.
>feel edges
You can't see any such thing.

The glass panes won't open. The cabinet seems to be locked, although you see no keyhole.

This tutorial has lots of built-in help on how to play text adventures. To read more, type "help"
followed by whatever it is you want to get help on, and then hit enter.
Topics you can get help on:
"help basics": The most important IF commands
"help commands": Some more common commands
"help talking": Commands for talking to other characters
"help system": Saving and loading games, quitting, and other system commands
"help special": Useful odds and ends (which may work differently in different games)
"help strategy": Figuring out what to do, when you're stuck
All of these topics are general information on playing IF. If you are stuck on a particular puzzle
in THE DREAMHOLD, type "help hint" for a single hint on what to try next.
>help strategy
Every text adventure is different. But here are some simple ideas which will help you in nearly
any game.
* Examine everything. (Type "help examine" for more on this command.) Even if there are many
things in the room, try to examine each one, at least once. Be systematic.
* Notice which objects the game is focussing your attention on, and which seem to be
background or scenery. (If it looks like the most important thing in the room, it probably is. If the
game says it's not important, it probably isn't.)
* Try to interact with things. Use common sense. If you see a button, push it. If you find a flute,
play it. And "take" anything that you can possibly lift.
* If you try a command on an object, and you get a distinctive response, your ears should perk
up. It means you're on the right track. Maybe you have to try a related command, or change
something else in the environment, or bring a second object in somehow. Maybe you won't be
able to complete the action until later in the game. But it's important.
* Notice when the game is leading you towards a specific command. If the game says "You
could probably bend the bars," then "bend bars" is worth trying.
* Pay attention to common elements. If you find rubies and emeralds, look for red and green
places to sell, put, or drop them. If a machine is made of brass, look for a brass part to add to it.
If a door is barred by shimmering silver light, look for anything that magically glows with a similar
light.
* When you find something which moves by itself, hang out and watch it for a while. You may
need to understand its entire range of movement.
And remember, the game world is a world. It has its own logic -- whimsy or dream logic perhaps,
but still sense. Find the game's time and reason, and follow it. You will find a way through.
>help commands
These are the most common ways of interacting with the game's world. It's usually worth trying
these, in almost any situation. You never know what might happen -- or what you might learn.
These commands do what they say. Common sense applies. There are many more possibilities
-- every game has its own variations, depending on what actions make sense in a particular
situation. For more information, type "help" followed by any command word.
"get thing", "drop thing"
"put this in that", "put this on that", "throw this at that"
"push thing", "pull thing", "turn thing"
"open thing", "close thing"
"lock this with that", "unlock this with that"
"touch thing", "smell thing", "listen to thing"
"eat thing", "drink thing"
"wear thing", "remove thing"
"search thing", "look in thing", "look under thing", "look behind thing"
"enter thing", "sit on thing", "climb thing"

Curtained Room
The walls of this small room are entirely swathed in heavy brocade curtains. The only openings
are to the west and northwest, and a closed lead-slab door to the south.
In the center of the room is a massive, high-backed chair of some pale wood. Directly before it is
a tall mirror in a standing frame.
>examine curtains
Curtains of dark silk brocade fall from ceiling to floor, all around you. The rough folds seem to
soak up sound; the silence drags at you.
>move curtains
The curtains are fixed overhead. They don't open or close.
>sit in chair
You sit down in the chair, facing the mirror.
>examine chair
The chair is cut from heavy planks of pale wood. It has a solid base, high arms and back --
nearly a throne, you think. The joinery is rough, but the surface has been finished to a smooth
fineness. The chair is positioned in front of a standing mirror.
>examine mirror
You blink and stare into the mirror. How odd.
The mirror reflects your chair, and the curtains behind you, perfectly. But your own form is
unclear -- as if the mirror were touched with some distorting oil. The blurring is strongest around
your upper body; your head appears to be a faceless blank.
Nervously, you raise your hand to your own face. Everything feels in its place. But your
reflection has raised a blurred hand to a featureless void.
And a dim white shadow seems to flit around your reflected body. Then it is gone.
>wear mask
Once again you hold the mask up before your face....

The door appears to be a single slab of dull grey lead. (Perhaps only a sheet of lead covering
ordinary wood, but... you don't think so.) It has no knob -- only a small keyhole beneath the
heavy opening-bar.

You see doorways to the south and in the southeast corner of the room. A white-painted door to
the east is closed.

If you doubted this was a dreamhold, you're certain now... the fireplace holds no wood, no ash.
An odd basket of coiled silver wire holds a heap of glassy, glowing, cherry-red spheres.
Insubstantial flames flicker above the spheres, and a mild warmth touches your face and body.
But the spheres do not truly burn; they are not consumed.
>take spheres
Ow! Despite the mildness of the spheres' warmth, their surface holds some humming, stinging
sensation which hovers on the edge of pain. You cannot touch them for even a moment.

single room.

You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

[You typed a command which could refer to more than one object. The game is asking you to
specify which you mean. You can type the name of one of these objects -- "leather armchair",
for example -- and the game will execute your command correctly.
(You can type just part of the name. A single word will usually suffice, if it picks out exactly one
option.)
You could also change your mind and type an entirely new command.]

Mosaic Room
The walls and ceiling of this room are entirely covered with tiny blue tiles. On the east wall, a
few black and grey tiles seem to depict birds on the horizon of a mosaic sky. The only exit is an
archway to the west.
A delicate cage of brass wire hangs from a curved stand in the center of the room. Within the
cage is a single ripe apple.
>examine cage
You've seen -- you might have seen -- such cages in the market, holding songbirds in their
shining wire embrace. This one, however, contains a ripe and perfect apple. You cannot
imagine why. The cage door is closed.
>open cage
You pull open the wire door. Then you jerk back; something invisible seems to burst from the
cage. It rolls across the room like lightning or dessicated time. It echoes.
The apple spots, rots, and sinks into itself in a single instant. Within a heartbeat, the fruit is a
withered husk -- as if it had sat in that cage for decades.
[You may have made a mistake. You're not likely to get that apple back. (One never knows, of
course, but that decay looked very final.) What can you do about it?
One option is to type "undo". This will let you "back up" one move -- back to just before you
opened the cage. Everything will be the same, except that the cage will still be closed and the
apple will still be fresh.
In this game, you can only "undo" one move in a row. So if you do something else now (even
"look" or "examine apple"), you won't be able to jump back to before the cage opened. The
"undo" command is intended only to fix immediate mistakes.
If you want to go back more than one turn, you'll have to use the "restart" or "restore"
commands. Type "help saving" for more information.
(Actually, many games protect you from severe mistakes. Since this is an introductory game,
you don't really have to worry about accidentally running into a dead end. If you truly need a
fresh apple, you'll probably find another way to get one.)]

Atelier
This cramped, boxy room appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floor are
splattered with paints of many colors. Strangely, the room is nearly empty; you see no stacks of
canvas or bottles of pigment. The exit is southwest.
A rough wooden easel is set up at one end of the room. Displayed upon it is a painting -- a
bright mountain landscape.
At the other end of the room, a tripod props up what looks like a small telescope.
A pigment-daubed board, no doubt the artist's palette, is sitting in a corner.
>examine painting
The painting shows a tiny rock pool amid jagged mountain peaks. The landscape is harsh and
unforgiving, but the pool seems a respite. It is rimmed with bright moss, and a few fish-like
shadows are visible in its depths.
The artist has depicted something brown lying on the pool's shore. It is small, hard to distinguish
amid the brushwork; but it seems to be a brown mask.

knife-like spires of rock. But in this sheltered nook, life flourishes. A small mossy pool, cool and
shadowed with tiny fish, has gathered below a rock-spring.
On the shore of the pool is a brown paper mask.

...Memory stirs...
In a darkened library, someone works alone. The tall shelves are crowded, but the rows of titles
fade into shadows; only the desk is illuminated. A map is spread upon it. The pen, moving
across its face, annotates and speculates.
Nearly half the map is tinted red. Along the border, marks and notations cluster like wasps.
The silver head snaps up, as an officer enters. He holds a pale cylinder, the length of a tall
man's finger. He places it on the desk; he bows; he turns and leaves. At no point do his eyes
rise from the floor.
The cylinder, unrolled, proves to be a length of parchment: filthy, closely lettered. The tall figure
reads it, once. Then the pen, taken up once again.
In the blank heart of the red-tinted region, quick strokes now emblazon the shape of a crutch.

Atelier
This cramped, boxy room appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floor are
splattered with paints of many colors. Strangely, the room is nearly empty; you see no stacks of
canvas or bottles of pigment. The exit is southwest.
A rough wooden easel is set up at one end of the room. Displayed upon it is a painting -- a
bright mountain landscape.
At the other end of the room, a tripod props up what looks like a small telescope.

Curving Hall
You are in a high, dim corridor, walled in cracked and moldering plaster. The only light comes
from tiny flickering candles above. The hall curves gently around from the south to the
northwest. You see an open door to the west; archways open to the northeast and east.
[If you get tired of typing "look" or "l" every time you return to a room, you can try the "verbose"
command. In "verbose" mode, the game will give a detailed description of each room as you

Mosaic Room
The walls and ceiling of this room are entirely covered with tiny blue tiles. On the east wall, black

You are carrying a knotted string, a desert landscape painting, a stone, a crumpled white letter,
a mountain landscape painting, a copper key, a quill pen, and two masks (a brown mask and a

[You're carrying quite a lot of stuff. You might be wondering how you can juggle it all. Some
games limit the number of things you can carry, or provide you with some kind of sack to carry
your loot around in.
However, many games -- including this one -- simply ignore the problem. Packing your luggage,
or stowing it in some central location, isn't all that much fun. Therefore, the game lets you carry
around as much as you want.]

You are holding a quill pen -- a sturdy black feather, its tip carefully cut to a nib. You have no

You draw the string out in your hands. It's less than a foot of crude, hairy twine, and it's wracked

of stream amid the greenery. Beyond the valley, the mountains rise again, and mountains
beyond that.
You stand for a moment, wondering at the view. "If I were a wizard," you think, "I would build a
house overlooking..." But the thought frays, wanders, and is lost.

Dim Shed
This room looks like nothing so much as a small, windowless garden shed. The floor is bare dirt;
the walls are unfinished planks. The only light falls in through the archway to the west. A narrow

A single glove is lying in the corner, lost and alone.

Mountain Path
You stand at the foot of a low rocky cliff. It squats above you, but it obscures little of the vast

to the south between them. To the north the path enters a crack in the cliff, meeting stairs which
vanish down into enclosed darkness.

Mountain Garden
A tiny pleasance-garden is nestled here, high on a mountainside. Odd bits of statuary stand
among the sculpted slopes and hillocks; small marble pillars mark the borders of the knotted
paths. The lawn is perfectly trimmed. The mountain towers above you to the north; high on its
face you see a featureless white dome. Above that, the sun shines in a wide blue mountain's
sky.
A tidy path runs north between mossy boulders. A wider path curves west, down a grassy slope,
and up to the east. To the south, a few marble steps lead to a balcony, which looks out over a
verdant valley. You can see a particularly tall statue on the balcony.
>examine statues
The garden is marked with marble. The corners and intersections of the spiralled paths are
picked out by small pillars; statues stand here and there, on hillocks and stretches of turf. The
style of carving is strange to you.
Cool mountain air brushes your face.
>x dome
To the north, high on the mountain above you -- not far below the highest peak -- a featureless
dome seems to survey the landscape. The surface is matte white and unreadable; but you can

You step up to the balustrade and look out, to the south...
Marble Balcony
Below this gently curved balcony, the world drops away into a green vista. The stony slopes of
the mountainside beneath you crumble, invaded by bracken and tree, until the mountain pines
merge into verdant forest and a lush valley floor. A bright thread marks a stream; a distant valley
lake is a silver arc. Beyond the valley, and around it, taller mountains stand like patient shadows
in the blue air.
In the center of the balcony, looking out -- as you are -- over the valley, a white marble statue
towers over you. Incongruously, you can see a small gold mask balanced on the statue's face.
>x gold mask
The gold mask rests on the statue's brow, high above you. It looks like a paper cutout of a

...Memory stirs...
A man and a woman; they lean on each other, a dim and distant exhaustion. Between them,
they cradle a dark-haired infant. It is the only thing in the world, as they always are.
A silver head shakes; a hand draws back the blanket. The infant has a clubbed foot -- twisted
and drawn in.
The couple put out their hands, once again. Light curls out of the air. Blue and green, violet and
no color at all, luminous currents slide down the infant's limbs. It twists and whines, fretting, but
the child is exhausted as well.
Then the light splinters and is gone. The foot is unchanged. The infant gathers itself for another
howl. Its parents rock it absently, but they are looking at each other. The silver-haired one snaps
a word -- both know the anger is self-directed, and is despair.

Warm Bower
This corner of the garden is cozily tucked into a natural alcove, surrounded by stone bluffs on
three sides. The sun is hot on your face. To the south, the ground drops away, revealing a lush
valley far below. The path back to the garden curves up around an outcropping to the east.
Small shrubs dot this garden bower, but a single tall and wild bush dominates the space. Its
branches twist in intricate profusion, then leap chaotically upward, spraying gold-veined leaves
through the air.
>s
Low shrubs keep you away from the cliff's edge. Probably this is for the best.
You catch a whiff of woodsmoke -- the same smoke you saw while descending the path. You
glance around for the fire...
...And realize that the smoke is drifting from the bush. You see no flames, nor even ember-glow;
but grey wisps curl from the coal-black stems and branches. The smoke trails up from the bush,
buoyed on its own heat, and vanishes upward in a wind-tossed ribbon.

You stand on a small promontory which juts out of the face of the mountain. Shrubs and raised
flowerbeds lie around you, except for the path which slopes down to the west. To the south and
east, a sharp dropoff looks out over a lush green valley.
In the center of the bower, a single dense bush squats, sullen and dark. Its branches knot
heavily around each other, then spread into sprays of delicate, blue-green needles. Strangely, a
chill fog seems to spread out from under the bush; it rolls across the ground and spills from the
edges of the promontory.

branches and small clusters of translucent white berries.

You reach into the bush, and -- with your gloved hand -- carefully strip a handful of berries from
a branch.
After a few moments, their translucency dulls to a cloudy white, and the chill you feel through

burning-cold.

The reply is a laugh. "Why spoil it?" And then soberly. "But as you carry yourself through years
and ages, do not hold such a garden -- even a living one -- unchanged. Such an artful place is
smaller than your mind; you cannot inhabit it without growing small and comfortable within it.
Build it -- destroy it -- rewrite it from lifetime to lifetime. Some masters of magic," the voice adds
in afterthought, "come to prefer the gardening."

Mountain Path
You stand at the foot of a low rocky cliff. It squats above you, but it obscures little of the vast
blue sky that stretches all around. Mossy boulders hem you in on either side; a tidy path winds
to the south between them. To the north the path enters a crack in the cliff, meeting stairs which
vanish down into enclosed darkness.
>s
The boulders open out as you follow the path.
Mountain Garden
A tiny pleasance-garden is nestled here, high on a mountainside. Odd bits of statuary stand
among the sculpted slopes and hillocks; small marble pillars mark the borders of the knotted
paths. The lawn is perfectly trimmed. The mountain towers above you to the north; high on its
face you see a featureless white dome. Above that, the sun shines in a wide blue mountain's
sky.
A tidy path runs north between mossy boulders. A wider path curves west, down a grassy slope,
and up to the east. To the south, a few marble steps lead to a balcony, which looks out over a
verdant valley.
>w
As you descend the path, you see a thread of smoke rising ahead.
Warm Bower
This corner of the garden is cozily tucked into a natural alcove, surrounded by stone bluffs on
three sides. The air is warm and dry. To the south, the ground drops away, revealing a lush
valley far below. The path back to the garden curves up around an outcropping to the east.
Small shrubs dot this garden bower, but a single tall and wild bush dominates the space. Its
branches twist in intricate profusion, then leap chaotically upward, spraying gold-veined leaves
through the air. Heat radiates from the bush, as if from a brazier.
>x bush
The wild bush is not broad, but it is taller than you. Its leaves are narrow, glossy, many-pointed,
and veined with gold amid a yellow blush. Clusters of brilliant orange berries hang
half-concealed amid the tangled black branches.
Heat radiates from the heart of the bush, warming the bower.
The taste of smoke catches you again.

You reach into the bush, and -- with your gloved hand -- carefully strip a handful of berries from
a branch.
After a few moments, their orange color dulls slightly, and the heat you feel through the glove
diminishes. Gingerly you prod a berry with your bare finger. It's warm, but no longer scalding.

Dim Shed
This room looks like nothing so much as a small, windowless garden shed. The floor is bare dirt;
the walls are unfinished planks. The only light falls in through the archway to the west. A narrow
opening to the south leads to a steep stairway, which climbs away into darkness.
"To stand in a dreamhold is to be no more than a thought in a wizard's dream." Or so it is said...
somewhere. Certainly this stairway is changeable as a dream.

Orrery
You stand in a wide, tall, and dimly lit chamber. It has six sides; smaller alcoves open to the
north and south.
The chamber is dominated by a vast machine: an engine of gears, shafts, and clattering motion.
It is primarily a great stately disk of brass which turns on a tilted axis. Smaller wheels pirouette
on the disk's face, bearing globes of delicate glass in their complicated courses.
The great brass disk continues its revolution. The silver wheel is borne out of reach.
You notice a blue mask fluttering from one of the glass globes on the machine's wheels.
>x blue mask
The blue mask looks like a blue paper cutout of a human face. It seems to be caught in the rings
that circle the tan glass globe.
The great brass disk continues its revolution.
>x machine
The brass disk nearly fills the room. It rises at a sharp angle; its lower edge is a few inches
above the floor, but the opposite edge approaches the high roof. Intricate arcs and lines are
engraved across its surface, measuring you know not what. The disk turns with a slow, steady
rotation.
A large globe of blue glass is embedded at the disk's center. The globe bears a delicate pattern
of brown and white, like a map of islands in an impossible curved sea. The globe is fixed; the
disk rotates around it.
A silver wheel makes its own revolutions on the upper left side of the disk. Opposite it, on the
lower right side, a copper wheel turns. The wheels are also carried slowly around with the great
disk's motion. Each wheel bears its own colored globes.
The silver wheel whirls past the top of its orbit. The copper wheel, opposite it, is at its lowest.
>x blue globe
The blue globe rests, unmoving, at the center of the great brass machine. It is mottled with
delicate brown and white patterns -- as if the map of an island archipelago had been painted on
a sphere.
The great brass disk continues its revolution. The copper wheel is borne out of reach.
>x wheel

rotates slowly. A smaller globe of tan is carried around the silver wheel's rim with its motion. The
tan globe is itself circled with heavy rings of frosted glass.
The silver wheel now occupies the upper right side of the great brass disk, as the engine

>take tan globe
You grab hold of one of the globe's rings. Your hand knocks the blue mask loose, and it falls to

...Memory stirs...
The rooflines of the city are slate over brick; but the tower is older stone. A silver-haired figure
looks down from an embrasured window. The largest building in view faces the tower, across
the square, perhaps in challenge. Its brick arches frame an intricate web wrought of iron. The
web shapes a symbol: an ornately styled crutch.
A small carved crutch hangs at the figure's throat; but this is simple, a few splinters of wood.
Absent fingers have smoothed the rough wood to a polish, here and there.
The people in the square do not look up; they go about their business quietly. Or -- all do but
one. One dark cloak is thrown down suddenly. A woman stands revealed in bright-dyed rags.
She is shouting, up at the tower, out through the square, around at the citizens who move away
from her. She spins, gesticulating. She points at the arched building; she points at the tower.
Above, looking down, a brow furrows beneath silver hair.
But the guards are coming, pushing through the crowd that melts away from the square. In
moments, the ragged woman too is cleared from sight.
The face in the window watches this. Not, perhaps, pleased; but satisfied enough. And then the
face turns away, back to the books and artifices within the stone tower.
The great brass disk continues its revolution. The copper wheel is borne out of reach.

North Alcove
This is a small, curved alcove, off a large chamber to the south. An archway to the north reveals
a flight of ascending stairs.
A pale gauzy rag is crumpled at the alcove's edge.
"But is it reality?" The question sparkles with unheeded eagerness; the questioner's gaze is
fiercely entangled among the turning rings and delicate gears.
"Of course it is not," comes the reply. "The model has not even the right form. The sky is not full
of wheels upon wheels. But--" overrunning the interruption "--that does not mean the model
lacks power." The voice is suddenly dry. "Symbolism and intent, child. What better symbol for
power than this: a machine just within our own limits of understanding?"
The machine clatters and whirrs.

This end of the corridor seems to be deep underground. A natural cave spreads out below; its
mammoth columns and cascades of flowstone are only dimly picked out by the candlelight

easily visible. A stream pours in from your right, tumbles from a ledge, and plummets into a pit

You are standing waist-deep in an empty earthenware tub, in the midst of a trackless jungle.
Heavy, entangled trunks and vines loom in every direction, as far as you can see -- and you

filters down to you. But golden flowers dot the trees, like bursts of sun.

"look" or "south"), you won't be able to jump back to the lit Passage. The "undo" command is
intended only to fix immediate mistakes.
If you want to go back more than one turn, you'll have to use the "restart" or "restore"
commands. Type "help saving" for more information.
Or you could stumble around in the dark, and try to find your way out. Since this is an
introductory game, there is a way out. And maybe more to discover, as well.]
>i
You are carrying a straw torch, an iron key, a scrap of gauze, a handful of warm berries, a
handful of cool berries, a glove (being worn), a knotted string, a desert landscape painting, a
stone, a crumpled white letter, a mountain landscape painting, a copper key, a quill pen, and
four masks (a blue mask, a gold mask, a brown mask, and a white mask).
You strain, hopelessly, to see anything. But perhaps your eyes are adjusting somewhat... there
is a dim glimmer of light in the distance.
>put orange berry on torch
You thrust the orange berry into the straw bundle. It bursts, spattering juice that immediately
flashes to flame. Sparks lodge throughout the straw... which crackles in response. In seconds
the torch is burning brightly.
You blink away dazzle-veils, and look around, trying to orient yourself.
Vaulting Cavern
A high, arched space opens around you, deep within the earth. The floor is unevenly
interspersed with stalagmites and stone columns; your torchlight glitters in droplets from the
stalactites above. Between the pale, hanging pinnacles of frozen stone, a vein of dark ore
streaks the vault.
A narrow passage leads away to the south. A broader one enters on the west side; it once
crossed the cave, but the eastern exit has collapsed. A low crawl runs northeast. At one edge of
the cave, a pit descends abruptly. Wisps of steam rise from its depths.
>x columns
Stalactites are the ones on the ceiling. Stalagmites are the ones on the floor. You don't know
how you know this.
>x floor
You can't see any such thing.
>x ore
The vein is a rusty black mark which cuts across the limestone vault above.
>x pit
The floor slopes sharply downward at the cave's edge, narrowing into a twisting pit. It looks like
you could climb down safely -- at least as far down as you can see. Wisps of steam rise from the
pit.
>x steam
A thin plume of steam drifts from the pit, rising in the cave's cool air. Perhaps there is a hot
spring somewhere below.
>smell steam
A hot mineral odor wafts from the depths of the pit.
>look in pt

>w
Shore of River
You stand on the eastern shore of a black river -- a silent sheet of mirror-dark water which slips
by as you watch. Somewhere, far to the south, you hear the thin roar of falling water. A broad
passage leads back to the east.
The far shore is a narrow ledge of scree. You can see a green mask lying amid the rubble there.
>x shore
The other side of the river is not as broad as the shore you stand on. It's just a sloping shelf of
fallen stone that descends to the water. A green mask is visible on the far shore.
>x river
The dark stream is three or four yards across. The water reflects the cave walls; you cannot see
beneath the surface. But you sense that it flows swiftly. Somewhere to the south, down the
river's passage, you can hear the water cascading down into some deeper abyss.
>put white berry in river
You toss a white berry into the water.
The response catches your breath away: planes of frost crackle across the river's surface.
Water eddies up around the obstruction, and is subsumed as quickly. The ice snaps and
groans, cracking and splitting and freezing again faster than you can follow.
In seconds, an uneven sheet of ice has formed across the entire width of the river. It seems
solid, although water hisses and bubbles underneath.
>w
Treading carefully, you cross the ice.
Far Shore of River
You have reached the western side of the subterranean river. A narrow shelf of loose rubble
slopes down to the water's frozen edge. The ice still spans the river, although it is slowly
wearing away in the silent current. The shore does not extend far up-stream or down; but at the
top of the slope, a narrow crawl leads southwest, away from the river-passage.
A green mask is lying in the scree.
You can see the upstream edge of the ice slowly, but steadily, wearing away in the current.
>take green mask
Taken.

>wear green mask
Gingerly, you raise the mask to your face....
...Memory stirs...
A tent rests in mud; it is rigidly upright, defying its stains and any weariness. Once-gold laces
twitch against once-white cloth. Then a figure is emerging. It too is rigidly upright, stained and
dirtied, although the hair remains silver.
Facing the tent are four soldiers. The man they surround is a soldier too; but his red sashes are
hasty, crudely torn from some flag and stitched to a soldier's common clothes. He looks too
young for them.
The man carries no weapon, though his escorts eye him as if he might pull one out of any
puddle of mud. What he carries instead is a length of hacked wood with a shattered handle. He
kneels -- in the mud -- and lays it at the tall figure's feet.
The eyes that peer down from beneath silver hair seem only tired. The figure turns away, and
reaches for the tent flap again. But a fist clenches on the lacing; harsh yellow light splinters the
air.
A length of wood, which might once have been a crutch -- once, a war ago -- flares into fire,
ember, and ash.
The ice creaks alarmingly.
>loo
That's not a verb I recognize.

Far Shore of River
You have reached the western side of the subterranean river. A narrow shelf of loose rubble
slopes down to the water's frozen edge. The ice still spans the river, although it is thin and
beginning to crack. The shore does not extend far up-stream or down; but at the top of the
slope, a narrow crawl leads southwest, away from the river-passage.
>sw
River Crawl
You are crouched in a narrow twisting crawlway. A faint rushing sound, distant above you,
reveals that you are some way below the dark river. The crawl slopes upward to the northeast,
back the way you came, and angles even more sharply downward to the southeast.
>se
You continue crawling down the steepening slope. You soon find it difficult to maintain your
grip...
Then, with a horrible lurch of your stomach, you slip. The stone floor drops away entirely; your
torch goes spinning through empty space as you flail, falling, for a hold that is not there.
After a long second, you slam into a rocky ledge.
Ledge in Pit
You are balanced on a ledge, leaning against the wall of a twisty, irregular pit. Across from you,
and slightly above, you can see a narrow opening in the wall. A climbable rough path leads
upward. You might be able to descend further, but the pit beneath you is nearly vertical, and the
stone is damp and slippery with condensation.
A warm breath of air rises slowly up the pit, steadily, carrying with it an eddying stream of mist.
Your torch, thankfully, has landed nearby.
>take torch
You pick up the flaming torch.
>x walls
The pit walls are misted with damp condensation.
>x pit

You slowly inch your way down the pit.
Deep in Pit
The shaft is roughly vertical here, and you cling to holds in the wall, hoping desperately that you
do not slip. Below you, the pit narrows even further; the smooth walls glisten with moisture. The
climb above looks marginally safer.
A warm breath of air rises slowly up the pit, steadily, carrying with it an eddying stream of mist.
>put white berry in pit
The white berry vanishes into the depths, glancing crystalline motes from the stone as it falls.
Almost immediately, an icy crackle resounds from far below. The warm mist turns in an instant
to a hard glitter in the air, as a wave of cold billows up the pit. The walls bloom white into frost.

You brace your knees and back against the smooth stone, one way and the other, and begin
the slow descent.
Depths of Pit
You hang in a narrow shaft, wedged knees-to-back between the walls. One hand clutches your
torch; with the other, you cling to an angle in the rock. You are certain you cannot keep hold
here for long.
You see a tarnished bracelet before you, wedged into a hollow in the pit wall.
Below you, the shaft widens out -- an impossible descent, which leads only to a bubbling
underground pool, jagged with rocks and shattered ice.
The frozen pool is visibly melting. A wisp of steam rises past you now.
>take braclet
You can't see any such thing.
>take bracelet
You steady your hold, lean slightly forwards, and manage to pop the tarnished bracelet out of its
hollow. Even better, you manage not to drop it down the shaft.

You see a broad band of darkly tarnished metal -- you cannot tell what metal -- an incomplete
ring, so that it may easily be slipped on and off. The outer surface is finely engraved with a
curving, cross-grained pattern.

Confusing Passage
The passageway runs from southwest to northeast, more or less. Great columns and masses of
stone rise from floor to ceiling; the tunnel divides and enjoins around them, a confusing wrangle
of minor branches.
>x columns
Stalactites are the ones on the ceiling. Stalagmites are the ones on the floor. You don't know
how you know this.
"The technique of the memory palace is commonplace," says a voice you remember, "not just
among wizards, but in all the mantic disciplines. One commonly uses one's home as an anchor:
familiar rooms, passages, possessions become the keys to organized thought and knowledge.
By passing through the house-in-mind, one passes unerringly through memory."
"Of course, among wizards, the technique may be elevated to a new plane."
>ne
You pick your way through the stone formations.
Dead End
The passage from the southwest comes to an abrupt end here, in a round, water-worn alcove.
The eastern wall is of dressed granite -- an intrusion in these deep natural caverns. A heavy iron
door is set into the wall; it is tightly shut.
>x door
The door is a massive iron affair with a high sill. It has no keyhole, only an iron bar for a handle.
The door is closed.
>open door
You push on the door -- and then set yourself and heave again; for it is as massive as it looks,
and weighted to close of its own accord. By leaning hard against the iron, you get it open. Light
pours from the other side -- gentle, but still bright after your torchlit exploration.
>e
You dodge through the slowly closing door.
Cistern, West
You are at the edge of an immense and empty elliptical chamber. The walls are of granite
blocks, tightly fitted and dressed, bare of window or ornament. It feels like a vast cistern, not a
place for human habitation. The only exit is the door directly west.
The floor is a flat, perfect plane of black stone... or metal... or glass. You can't tell what it is. The
roof, far above, is an equally flat and perfect surface of featureless, luminescent white. Both
spread out eastward, defining the chamber between them. And halfway in between, a glass
catwalk runs around the wall, girdling the room.
A black column rises along the east wall, from the black floor up to the catwalk.
The iron door swings to with a faint boom.
>x floor
The floor is a black, blank ellipse. The surface seems like it should be reflective, but you can
see no reflection within it -- not even the soft glare of the roof.
>x ceiling
The ceiling is a white ellipse, remote and blank. It radiates a featureless white glow, which
illuminates the chamber -- a perfect and shadowless light.
A catwalk is hung around the perimeter wall, well below the ceiling, though far above you.
>x catwalk
The catwalk is far above you, though only halfway to the luminescent ceiling. It seems to be a
single elliptical pathway of glass, running most of the way around the perimeter of the room. The
glass, or crystal, is colorless and impossibly clear... but not perfect; you think you can see
cracks. It's difficult to tell from down here.
You can see a small red shape -- another mask -- resting on the catwalk, at the east edge of its
ellipse.
>x red mask
The red mask is on the catwalk, high above the eastern side of the room. You can see it clearly
through the glass.
[If you want a hint on getting the red mask, type "help hint".]
>help hint
Asking for a hint?
THE DREAMHOLD has an extensive hint system, which covers all the puzzles in the main
storyline. (There are quite a few discoveries which are left for you to make on your own! But
those are all optional. You can get hints on everything which you need to reach the end of the
game.)
If you type "help hint" again, you will get a hint on your current situation. You can use this
command anywhere in the game. If there's an unsolved puzzle nearby, the hint will address it; if
not, you'll be given general guidance.
But remember, hints always spoil the fun -- at least a little bit. You might be able to work it out
yourself if you keep trying. Only type "help hint" if you really think you're stuck.

Cistern, West
You are at the edge of an immense and empty elliptical chamber. The walls are of granite
blocks, tightly fitted and dressed, bare of window or ornament. It feels like a vast cistern, not a
place for human habitation. The only exit is the closed door directly west.
The floor is a flat, perfect plane of black. The roof, far above, is an equally flat and perfect
surface of featureless, luminescent white. Both spread out eastward, defining the chamber
between them. And halfway in between, a glass catwalk runs around the wall, girdling the room.
A black column rises along the east wall, from the black floor up to the catwalk.
>e
Cistern, East
You are at the eastern side of the elliptical cistern, standing next to a low glass platform. The
platform is about three strides across; it juts out from the granite wall, a bare inch above the
dead-black floor.
High above you, a glass catwalk runs around the room's perimeter.
A black column rises along the east wall, from the black floor up to the catwalk. It passes just to
the right of the platform.
A heavy iron lever rises from the platform, by the wall.
>x lever
The lever is just a plain iron bar. Its base is clearly a socket, although you cannot see what
mechanism it connects to -- the glass beneath it is oddly shadowed.
>pull lever
(first stepping onto the glass platform)
You pull the lever, which clunks stiffly down. The clunk is echoed from below you.
A curious thick gurgle sounds, somewhere below you.
>stand
You step from the platform down onto the black surface.
The gurgle is louder now.
>z
Time passes.
Suddenly, the black surface beneath you -- the entire floor -- begins sinking away, in ripples, like
draining oil. The black column lengthens (or is uncovered) as it goes. The true bottom of the
cistern is quickly revealed: a deep, sloping well, lined with granite blocks, as the walls are.
You are borne down with the tide, until the last few courses of stone emerge from the blackness
beneath your feet.
Cistern, Bottom
You are at the bottom of the cistern, at the edge, where the down-sloping floor meets the east
wall. Directly above you hangs the glass platform; yards above that, the catwalk
circumnavigates the room; and above that, the white ellipse of the ceiling spreads its featureless
radiance.
A black column rises along the east wall, from the floor up to the catwalk. It passes just to the
right of the platform.
At the lowest angle of the floor, just by the wall, you see a black circle -- a small disk of the
featureless substance which once floored this entire chamber. The black column merges into its
rim.
A heavy iron wheel is set into the eastern wall.
>x wheel
The wheel is supported on a thick hub which protrudes from the wall. The edge is deeply
notched, as if the wheel were meant to be gripped and turned -- it reminds you of a ship's
rudderwheel.
>turn wheel
You spin the wheel to the left until it stops. A faint vibration within the metal -- perceptible only
when you laid hands on it -- slowly stills.
Between a breath and a breath, the black column vanishes. It goes from the top end down -- like
a rope cut loose from the catwalk, slithering straight down into the well without a waver or a
splash.
The remaining circle of black sinks away, revealing a brass grating at the bottom of the slope.
You now see a line of handholds -- a ladder -- cut into the wall, where the column previously
rose. They ascend from the cistern's bottom, where you stand, past the glass platform, up to the
catwalk.
>x lader
You can't see any such thing.
>x ladder
They're just shaped hollows in the granite.

It's a round slab of rough hammered brass, pierced by finger-sized holes. You can see only

A heavy iron lever rises from the platform, by the wall.
>u
Cistern Catwalk, East
You stand on the catwalk -- or rather, in the catwalk. The glass surface is curved, forming a
shallow trough. It begins here, on the east side of the cistern, and follows the wall around to the
north.
Just past the end of the catwalk, a ladder runs down the wall.
A heavy brass pipe protrudes from the wall, between the catwalk and the ladder. The end of the
pipe is a curved fitting, which ends in a graceful brass spout. But the spout does not point down;
it curves to the right, towards the ladder.
A red mask is lying in the trough.
>x red nask
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the red mask.
>x red mask
It looks like a red paper mask, half life-size. But its curves are only delicate shading; the mask is
flat, a red cutout of a face.
The face depicted wears a mix of confidence and anger.
>take red mask

...Memory stirs...
True and heavy beams of wood frame the hall; it is dominated by a high table. At the head of
the table, a tall figure stands -- silver hair, intricately stitched robes -- drawing all eyes.
A sharp gesture. To one side, a half-grown boy frowns, tries to ask a question. He is shushed
fiercely and without a glance.
At the door, uniformed guards carry in a bundle of cloth. The silver-haired figure stares at it --
stares at it for long moments.
A guard, moved finally by the silence, unfolds the cloth. Eyes jerk; but there is still no sound.
Eventually, the tall figure moves a hand again. The wet red stains that have been revealed
sparkle, glow, and slowly vanish from the cloth. It is only a gesture; it is all anyone can do; it is
nothing.
Muffling a cry, the boy leaps up and limps for the door. Hurrying, his uneven steps are more halt
than usual. His face twists in pain; but no one moves to help him.
>look
Cistern Catwalk, East
You stand on the catwalk -- or rather, in the catwalk. The glass surface is curved, forming a
shallow trough. It begins here, on the east side of the cistern, and follows the wall around to the
north.
Just past the end of the catwalk, a ladder runs down the wall.
A heavy brass pipe protrudes from the wall, between the catwalk and the ladder. The end of the
pipe is a curved fitting, which ends in a graceful brass spout. But the spout does not point down;
it curves to the right, towards the ladder.
>x catwalk
The catwalk is a shallow glass trough, a yard wide and perhaps a foot deep. It begins here, and
seems to curve almost all the way around the room at this level.
The glass is thick and clear, but somewhat uneven at the edges -- small chips and cracks mar it.
>x pipe
The pipe is a thick tube of hammered brass, with heavy fittings. It extends about a foot from the
wall; it is just beyond the catwalk's end and just above the catwalk's level. The end of the pipe is
a graceful curved spout, which bends towards the ladder.
The spout looks slightly loose on its fitting, as if you could turn it.
>turn pipe
You rotate the spout to the left. It now curves out over the catwalk.

Cistern Catwalk, Northeast
You stand in the glass trough, on the northeast side of its arc. It runs northwest and southeast
from here.
A large, curved slab of glass is leaning in the trough here. It rests on edge, nearly upright,
although the way it wedges against the sides keeps it from falling.
You can also see two blobs of gum (a small gum blob and a big gum blob) here.
>x slab
The glass slab is irregular, a foot wide and a few feet long. It has a gentle, even curve along its
length. The slab is standing edge-up in the trough, crossing it from side to side.
>x blob
Which do you mean, the small gum blob or the big gum blob?

Cistern Catwalk, North

The catwalk is somewhat cracked at this point. The cracks spiderweb several feet of the glass
surface; at their center, a small hole is broken right through.

runs southwest and northeast from here.

Cistern Catwalk, South

A black column descends from the catwalk on the southeast side of the room.
>e
Cistern Catwalk, Southeast
The black catwalk curves around from the southwest, but it bends sharply outward here --
straight into the southeast wall, where it ends.
A brass grate is set into the wall, at the trough's end. The black substance runs up to the grate;
but it does not pass through -- it seems to be blocked by a gauzy pale film that coats the brass.
Instead, the blackness spills up and over the edges of the catwalk, joining the black column
beneath your feet.
A crumpled black wad is lying here, barely visible against the catwalk.
>take black wad
You pluck the wad from the catwalk, and try to smooth it out. It proves to be a chart, incised with
fine white lines and lettering.
>x chart
The chart depicts ruling dynasties through time. Its lettering is inhumanly precise, etched in
white on an odd black material. The chart's scale is so large that individual names do not
appear; single lives are only jogs and serifs in the asterisms of descent.
You recognize a few of the family names, a few of the countries and states and kingdoms -- not
many, and all seem distant and unimportant. But your eye is drawn to a rift in the middle of the
chart. Many lines end there. New lines begin beyond it. Dynasties across the world seem to
break or shear from that brief stretch... though "brief" is an interval of centuries, if you read the
scale correctly.
A concise note by the rift reads: "Colloquially, the Silver Demon Age. Plague? War? Widespread
turmoil and political instability. Records unusually rare from this era."
And below that, in a different and familiar scrawl: "History is larger than any one man: this
therefore is no history."
>take film
Much of the grate's surface is buried beneath the black tide. You peel away the upper edge of
the gauze, but the material below is trapped; you cannot pull it free.

Cistern Catwalk, East
You stand on the catwalk -- or rather, on the black substance which fills the catwalk's trough. It
begins here, on the east side of the cistern, and follows the wall around to the north.
A black column descends from the catwalk on the southeast side of the room.
Just past the end of the catwalk, a ladder runs down the wall.
A heavy brass pipe protrudes from the wall, between the catwalk and the ladder. The spout on
the end of the pipe curves left, towards the catwalk. An arc of the blackness falls from the spout;
it merges seamlessly into the black substance which fills the trough.
>d
You shift yourself to the handholds and descend.
Cistern, East (on the glass platform)
You are standing on a glass platform at the eastern side of the elliptical cistern. The platform is
about three strides across; it juts out over a deep well.
High above you, a glass catwalk runs around the room's perimeter.
A black column descends along the southeast wall, from the catwalk down to the floor, and then
down the slope to the bottom of the room.
Handholds cut into the wall, to the right of the platform, form a ladder leading both up and down.
A heavy iron lever rises from the platform, by the wall.
>d
Cistern, Bottom
You are at the bottom of the cistern, at the edge, where the down-sloping floor meets the east
wall. Directly above you hangs the glass platform; yards above that, the catwalk
circumnavigates the room; and above that, the white ellipse of the ceiling spreads its featureless
radiance.
A black column descends along the southeast wall, from the catwalk down to the floor, and then
down the slope to the bottom of the room.
At the lowest angle of the floor, just by the wall, you see a black circle -- a small disk of the
featureless substance which once floored this entire chamber. The black column angles down
the slope to merge with its rim.
Simple handholds cut into the wall form a ladder leading upwards.
A heavy iron wheel is set into the eastern wall.
>turn wheel
You spin the wheel to the left until it stops. A faint vibration within the metal -- perceptible only
when you laid hands on it -- slowly stills.
Between a breath and a breath, the black column vanishes. It goes from the top end down -- like
a rope cut loose from the catwalk, slithering straight down into the well without a waver or a
splash.
The remaining circle of black sinks away, revealing a brass grating at the bottom of the slope.
>w
You walk up the slope.
Cistern, West
You are at the edge of an immense and empty elliptical chamber. The walls are of granite
blocks, tightly fitted and dressed, bare of window or ornament. It feels like a vast cistern, not a
place for human habitation. The only exit is the closed door directly west.
The stone floor is level where you stand, but to the east it slopes sharply down. The roof, far
above, is a flat and perfect surface of featureless, luminescent white. Halfway up to it, a glass
catwalk runs around the wall, girdling the room.
A brass grate is set into the the floor near the door.
>put rag on grate
You begin spreading the circle of gauze across the grating. It clings, and seems almost to shift
in your fingers; and now you see that the holes in the pale web line up precisely with the holes
in the brass beneath it. In a few moments, the grating is entirely covered.
>e
You walk down the angled floor.
Cistern, Bottom
You are at the bottom of the cistern, at the edge, where the down-sloping floor meets the east
wall. Directly above you hangs the glass platform; yards above that, the catwalk
circumnavigates the room; and above that, the white ellipse of the ceiling spreads its featureless
radiance.
A brass grate is set into the lowest angle of the floor, just by the wall.
Simple handholds cut into the wall form a ladder leading upwards.
A heavy iron wheel is set into the eastern wall.

You seize the stone handholds and begin climbing.
Cistern, East (on the glass platform)
You are standing on a glass platform at the eastern side of the elliptical cistern. The platform is

High above you, a glass catwalk runs around the room's perimeter.
Handholds cut into the wall, to the right of the platform, form a ladder leading both up and down.
A heavy iron lever rises from the platform, by the wall.

You push the lever, which clunks freely back up. The clunk is echoed from below you.

You are at the bottom of the cistern, at the edge, where the down-sloping floor meets the east

A brass grate is set into the lowest angle of the floor, just by the wall.
Simple handholds cut into the wall form a ladder leading upwards.
A heavy iron wheel is set into the eastern wall.
>turn wheel
You spin the wheel to the right until it stops. As you do, a faint, unsteady vibration grows in the
metal.
The black column reappears: spilling down from the catwalk on the southeast side of the room,
to the floor, and then down the slope, in one dark silent fall.
The bottom of the cistern begins filling once again with the black substance. It ripples outward
from the base of the column.
The black tide rises under your feet, bearing you upward. In moments, the platform is covered;
and the catwalk is approaching; and then the catwalk is submerged as well. The tide lifts you
towards the shining roof.
>d
Up seems more likely.
The black floor continues to rise, and you along with it.
>x ceiling
The ceiling is a white ellipse, remote and blank. It radiates a featureless white glow, which
illuminates the chamber -- a perfect and shadowless light.
Your ascent continues. The chamber is beginning to seem much less lofty than it once was.
>c floor
That's not a verb I recognize.
>x floor
The floor is a black, blank ellipse. The surface seems like it should be reflective, but you can
see no reflection within it -- not even the soft glare of the roof.
The bright glow of the roof is getting closer.
>w
The door is gone, submerged. You see no other way out of the cistern chamber.
The roof is nearly within reach now.
You glance around in panic. You still can't see any way out.
>z
Time passes.
The black floor and the white ceiling meet, and merge. The infinitesmal gap, too narrow even for
a ray of light or darkness, excludes all possibility; within that moment you see all your own time,
moving more swiftly than thought.
Nothing is simpler, for that moment, than to move into it.
Grey Chamber
This space forms an ellipse around you; but the walls are featureless, and the planes above and
below are indistinct, indistinguishable. You do not recognize this world. Even the silence is not
the silence of the caverns. Your movements raise no echo.
A small gap to the west reveals an opening to more familiar stone and darkness.
A shield, a gleaming triangular buckler, hangs between floor and roof. Its bright lines are the
only sharp edges about this place.
> x sheild
You can't see any such thing.
>x shield
The buckler is a small, slightly curved triangle of bright metal. Its face is bossed with the image
of three crossed spears. The back is less polished, and lacks the straps you would expect.
>take sheild
You can't see any such thing.
>take sheild
You can't see any such thing.
>take shield
Taken.
Even your breathing is muffled. If indeed you do breathe, here. You are suddenly unsure.
[An extra discovery has been added to your score.]
>breathe
You take a startling gasp of a breath. Had you not been breathing?
>listen
You hear nothing at all.
>look
Grey Chamber
This space forms an ellipse around you; but the walls are featureless, and the planes above and
below are indistinct, indistinguishable. You do not recognize this world. Even the silence is not
the silence of the caverns. Your movements raise no echo.
A small gap to the west reveals an opening to more familiar stone and darkness.
Time seems to thicken and slow around you.
>x gap
To the west, a passage of familiar, water-sculpted stone leads away from this place.
>w
You creep into the gap. The air seems to change around you, to the common cool damp of the
caverns. In moments, you emerge -- into a familiar confusion of stone. You look behind you,
trying to remember which passage let you free.
Confusing Passage
The passageway runs from southwest to northeast, more or less. Great columns and masses of
stone rise from floor to ceiling; the tunnel divides and enjoins around them, a confusing wrangle
of minor branches.
A small gap is visible in the stone to the southeast.
>put white berry on torch
You drop a white berry into the burning straw. An odd blue light crackles through the flame, and
for a moment you feel a lancing chill. Then the fire is quenched -- and all light drains away in an
instant.
Darkness
It is utterly dark... the darkness of the spaces within the world.
>z
Time passes.
You strain, hopelessly, to see anything. But perhaps your eyes are adjusting somewhat... there
is a dim glimmer of light in the distance.
>x light
A faint light blooms, somewhere in the distance, in the dark. Your sense of direction is
hopelessly muddled, but it could be a reflection of a reflection of light on stone -- the passage by
which you entered this place.
>enter light
You move towards the light, slowly; feeling each step in the dark, as if an unseen slope or pit
were waiting. Which may be.
After a time, the light seems stronger.
Darkness
Darkness is all around you... infinitely far away, and an inch from your groping hands.
But you can make out the faintest glimmer of light, somewhere.
>leave light
You set your back to the light, as best you can. And you move, slowly -- reaching ahead with
every step -- into the empty and utter dark.
The trace of light dims behind you.
Darkness
You are somewhere within utter darkness, somewhere within the earth.
But you can make out the faintest glimmer of light, somewhere.
>g
You stumble on an unseen unevenness in the stone. And you steady, trying to catch your
balance, and continue onward.
The trace of light dims behind you.
Darkness
You are somewhere within utter darkness, somewhere within the earth.
But you can make out the faintest glimmer of light, somewhere.
[You are lost in the dark.
It's a frightening situation, but one you will inevitably fall into, from time to time. The best
defense is to carry a light source -- but it's too late for that now. (Unless you can put one
together from the items you're carrying.) You'll have to find a way back to the lit world.
In some games, wandering around in the dark is very dangerous. There can be monsters, or
bottomless pits. However, this game's darkness is safe... relatively safe.]

But you can make out the faintest glimmer of light, somewhere.
>g
Something moves against the face of the darkness.
But it is not light.
Subterrane World
The world is picked out, not in shades or tints or degrees of black; but in qualities of darkness.
Each has a name; each whispers to you.
In utter night, you sense the cavernous space around you -- vaulted roof as clear in the
darkness as the rough-hewn floor. Without sight, you perceive behemoth columns of stone,
shaped to perfect smoothness and standing in perfect circular array. Eyeless, you are aware of
the vast carved form high above.
In the center of the stone circle is an acute angle of darkness: a dagger, balanced on its point.
>take dagger
You reach out (your hand, you suddenly notice, is the only indistinct form in this sightlessness)
and seize the dagger's hilt.
It is surprisingly heavy; and the hilt is obsidian, glassy-smooth against your fingers. But your
attention is gripped by the rent which the blade leaves behind -- a narrow crack of emptiness
against darkness.
[An extra discovery has been added to your score.]
>x rent
The rent stretches from the floor to higher than you can reach, but it is narrow as... how narrow
is it? It seems, perhaps, like an infinite plane turned edge-on to your odd perception.
>enter rent
You move towards the rent.
The darkness parts around you. What remains is not light; but a flickering motion, and a sound
as of the voice of fluting wind...
...and then the flickering is light; ordinary, flickering flames, which illuminate a comfortably
familiar room.
Sitting Room (on the settee)
This room seems more inviting. The walls are painted with delicate patterns of flowers, which
merge into a soft-hued carpet beneath your feet. Two chairs and a cushioned settee face a
bright-flickering fireplace on the far wall.
You see an empty hook above the fireplace.
You see doorways to the south and in the southeast corner of the room. A white-painted door to
the east is open.
>x setter
You can't see any such thing.
>x settee
In the center of the room, a wide settee faces the fireplace. Its drapes and cushions are
swathed in velvet of worn eggshell-green.
>look under settee
Not even dust.
>x fireplace
If you doubted this was a dreamhold, you're certain now... the fireplace holds no wood, no ash.
An odd basket of coiled silver wire holds a heap of glassy, glowing, cherry-red spheres.
Insubstantial flames flicker above the spheres, and a mild warmth touches your face and body.
But the spheres do not truly burn; they are not consumed.
>take sphere
With your gloved hand, you pluck one sphere from the glowing heap. Almost immediately, its
red light fades, leaving a dim grey glassiness.
Hmm. You cautiously hold your other hand above the grey sphere, then touch it. You feel only
cool glass.
>e
You'll have to get off the settee first.
>s
You'll have to get off the settee first.

Curving Hall
You are in a high, dim corridor, walled in cracked and moldering plaster. The only light comes
from tiny flickering candles above. The hall curves gently around from the south to the
northwest. You see an open door to the west; archways open to the northeast and east.
>s
Curving Hall, South End
The curving corridor ends here. The blank plaster wall to the south features a large window;
sunlight pours in, brightening this end of the hall. You can go through the archway to the east,
take the stairs which ascend to the west, or return north along the corridor.
>w
You ascend the stairs.
Dark Dome, East
You stand at the east edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the west, arching into an
immense dome. A diffuse illumination spreads across the lower reaches, barely bright enough
to see by.
There is an open archway to the east; beyond it, stairs descend. You can also see a ladder in
the distance, at the north edge of the dome.
>w
Dark Dome, Center
You stand at the center of a vast round space. An immense dome arches above you. A diffuse
illumination spreads across the lower reaches, barely bright enough to see by.
In the distance to the east, you can see a doorway; a ladder is visible far to the north.
In the center of the floor sits an odd basket of coiled silver wire. The metal pyramid that covered
the basket lies open, leaning to one side.
>put sphere in basket
As you drop the grey sphere into the basket, its glassy surface flares with a brilliant white light.
You shield your eyes as the dome is flooded with light.
>x dome

The light from the sphere fades smoothly to a vivid gold.

>close pyramid
You heave the pyramid back upright, covering the basket. The black light from the sphere is cut
off; but gradually you see patterns in the darkness above you.
The dome is now filled with familiar stars. Among the constellations, you can see the Iron Moth
to the north; Parhu's Galley and Juinua's Wall to the east; the Cloak of Night and the Southern
Axe to the south; the Doorstep of Heaven to the west; and the Crutch and the Bull-and-Cow
directly above you.
>x crutch
The Crutch is a bright zig-zag of stars high overhead. King Maijnir the Farsighted quarrelled with
his son Walking Boy. He wounded Walking Boy's foot, and then exiled him to walk the
boundaries of his kingdom, bearing only rags, tatters, and a crutch of gold.
>x bull
The Bull and Cow are small star-groups near the zenith. Jernos desired Seroa, the wife of the
Southern king. She turned herself into a sparrow and fled; he turned himself into a horhawk and
followed her. Seroa hid herself in many other shapes, but each time Jernos changed into
something that could find her. Finally she turned herself into a bull. Jernos turned into a cow, but
a cow was too stupid to chase Seroa further. Seroa-the-bull mounted the Jernos-the-cow and
sired eight brass calves.
You've never been quite sure what the moral of that story was supposed to be.
>w
Starry Dome, West
You stand at the west edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the east, arching into an
immense dome. The dome is filled with familiar stars.
Among the stars in the western sky, you see the constellation of the Doorstep of Heaven.
At the north edge of the dome, off in the distance, you can see a ladder. All the way across the
dome to the east, a doorway is barely visible.
>x doorstep
The Doorstep of Heaven is a near-perfect circle of stars in the western sky. It marks the gate, or
guards the gate, through which the dead travel to the All-Place. Funereal ceremonies always
begin when the Doorstep rises, day or night.
>
Starry Dome, South
You stand at the south edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the north, arching into an
immense dome. The dome is filled with familiar stars.
Among the stars in the southern sky, you see the constellations of the Cloak of Night and the
Southern Axe.
At the east edge of the dome, off in the distance, you can see a doorway. All the way across the
dome to the north, a ladder is barely visible.
>x cloak. take it. x it. wear it.
The Cloak of Night is a ragged patch of starless dark, low in the south, just above the horizon.
The Lady of Summer leaves it lying there half the year, while she dances. In winter she takes up
her cloak to wrap herself, as she sits by the fire to tell stories.
The Cloak is low on the dome, just above your head. It seems low enough to touch.
You reach up and pull. Heavy, black cloth flows silently down into your arms.
It's a heavy armful of black cloth. Black, blacker -- blacker than that. But light, like twinkling dust,
drifts in the deepest folds.
You swing the cloak around yourself. It is not so heavy on your shoulders; but warm, very warm.
[An extra discovery has been added to your score.]
>x axe. e.
An irregular double-curve of stars, high in the south, the Axe takes the form of the traditional
southern weapon. The Hero of Torcova lived so close to his axe that the storymongers called it
his wife. (Fortunately for them, he was a hero.) When he was mortally wounded at Deven, the
axe agreed to die in his place. The Hero remained nameless in Torcova, awaiting the greatest
battle to come, and the axe moved towards Heaven.
Starry Dome, East
You stand at the east edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the west, arching into an
immense dome. The dome is filled with familiar stars.
Among the stars in the eastern sky, you see the constellations of Parhu's Galley and Juinua's
Wall.
There is an open archway to the east; beyond it, stairs descend. You can also see a ladder in
the distance, at the north edge of the dome.
>x galley. x wall. n.
Parhu's Galley is visible to the east. A row of dim stars mark the oars of the galley slaves. Parhu
flung himself into the sea and drowned, but he did not rescind his oath, and so his slaves are
bound to row forever after Parhu's Ruby, the red star beyond the Galley's prow.
The stars of Juinua's Wall run high above the eastern horizon. Juinua of Junorr was given a
prophecy, that her blood would stain the walls of Junorr before her thirtieth year. Instead of
tearing down the city wall, she ordered it built higher -- a new course of great stones every year.
In her twenty-ninth year, she was crushed by a stone as she supervised the work on the wall.
Or, depending who tells the tale, she died giving birth to a stone; or she was murdered by the
master builder; or she died of the flux in an overcrowded city street.
Starry Dome, North
You stand at the north edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the south, arching into an
immense dome. The dome is filled with familiar stars.
Among the stars in the northern sky, you see the constellation of the Iron Moth.
A ladder reaches both upwards and downwards from here, passing through openings in the
floor and in the dome's skirt. You can also see a doorway off in the distance, at the far east
edge of the dome.
>x moth. u.
The stars of the Iron Moth hang high in the northern sky. The Moth never sets; it flutters
constantly around and around the Utter North, which is always near its bright left antenna.
Lodestones are dust from the Moth's wing.
You climb up, through the dome, and a long way farther...
Translucent Dome
You are in a small round dome, much smaller than the vast dark space below. The curving
surface is translucent, bright with the daylight filtering in from outside. The floor beneath your
feet is a harsh metal grating. The ladder runs from a hole in the grating, near the south side, up
to a matching opening in the dome above.
A low platform fills the center of the floor. The platform is piled high with split lengths of wood.
A tall triangle of beaten copper rises along the north side of the dome.
>x dome. x platform. x triangle. x track. u.
Daylight gives the dome a soft white glow, although you can see nothing outside.
The wood is laid out in an immense, semicircular heap. It looks like nothing so much as a
bonfire, ready for the spark.
(the tall copper triangle)
It is a thin sheet of hammered copper, as wide at the base as your outstretched arms. The sheet
tapers as it rises, curving inward as it hugs the dome's inner surface. Its peak is halfway up the
dome. The shape reminds you of a billowing sail.
The copper triangle stands to the north, but its base rests in a narrow track that runs all the way
around the dome.
A narrow circular track runs around the room, a bare finger's width from the dome's lower edge.
The copper sail rests in this track on the north side of the dome.
You climb up and out.
Catwalk, South
This railless catwalk circles the outer edge of a pale dome. You stand at the southern edge of
the circle; the catwalk disappears around the dome to the east and west. A few iron steps lead
up to an opening in the dome, from which a ladder descends inside.
The dome is nestled high on the shoulder of a sunlit mountain peak. Below you, a small terrace
is filled with knotted and spiralled garden paths. And far below that, green and bright, a lush
valley spreads out into the distance.
>x terrace. x valley. w.
A garden is visible below and to the south -- nestled in a terrace, well below the dome, though
still high on the mountain's flank. The paths and plantings are tiny from this vantage. At the far
edge of the garden a balcony looks out, as you do, over the green and sunlit valley.
The valley is infinite in detail, though bounded by stone. The trees are spread in afternoon
sunlight.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving west around the dome.
Catwalk, West
You are at the western edge of a catwalk which circles a pale dome. The dome rises from the
face of a sunlit mountain peak, which towers to the north. To the south, the stone slopes
descend to a wide valley, shining green in the afternoon light.
> x mountain. n.
(the mountain landscape painting)
The painting shows a tiny rock pool amid jagged mountain peaks. The landscape is harsh and
unforgiving, but the pool seems a respite. It is rimmed with bright moss, and a few fish-like
shadows are visible in its depths.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving north around the dome.
Catwalk, North
You stand on a narrow, railless catwalk, which girdles the translucent dome to the south. To the
north, the mountain rises massively above you. But the dome stands on its own promontory; the
mountain face is several yards away. The ravine between dome and mountain is deep and
jagged.
There is a tiny ledge on the face of the mountain. You can just make out a black mask balanced
on the ledge.
>x ravine. x ledge. x black mask. jump over ravine. x dome. e.
There is a gap, several yards wide, between the body of the mountain and the outcropping that
supports the dome. Gazing down, you can see only that the ravine's bottom is very narrow;
jagged rocks are mercilessly visible.
It's just a narrow ledge which juts from the mountainside, across the ravine from you. There is a
black mask balanced on the ledge.
The black mask looks like a black paper cutout of a human face. It is resting on a thin ledge on
the mountainside, across the ravine to the north.
The ravine is much too wide.
The dome crouches above you to the south. The milky surface prevents you from seeing inside;
sunlight diffuses across the dome as if it were mist. You can just make out a triangular
silhouette within the dome's surface -- the outline of the copper sail.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving east around the dome.
Catwalk, East
You are at the eastern edge of a catwalk which circles a pale dome. The dome rises from the
face of a sunlit mountain peak, which towers to the north. To the south, the stone slopes fall to a
verdant valley.
> s.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving south around the dome.
Catwalk, South
This railless catwalk circles the outer edge of a pale dome. You stand at the southern edge of
the circle; the catwalk disappears around the dome to the east and west. A few iron steps lead
up to an opening in the dome, from which a ladder descends inside.
The dome is nestled high on the shoulder of a sunlit mountain peak. Below you, a small terrace
is filled with knotted and spiralled garden paths. And far below that, green and bright, a lush
valley spreads out into the distance.
>d
You step up to the opening and climb down into the dome.
Translucent Dome
You are in a small round dome. The curving surface is translucent, bright with the daylight
filtering in from outside. The floor beneath your feet is a harsh metal grating. The ladder runs
from a hole in the grating, near the south side, up to a matching opening in the dome above.
A low platform fills the center of the floor. The platform is piled high with split lengths of wood.
A tall triangle of beaten copper rises along the north side of the dome.
>put orange berry on platform.
You toss the orange berry into the heaped wood. It bursts and flares, spattering sparks of fiery
juice. The wood crackles, slow to catch... but, after a few moments, a tongue of flame is licking
up through the pile.
A few moments more, and the heap is a roaring bonfire. You blink, turning from the intense
heat.
>x fire. u.
The wood blazes away, filling the dome with light, heat, and smoke.
The quality of the light outside changes subtly.
The sky fades to night as you climb.
Catwalk, South; Night
This railless catwalk circles the outer edge of a pale dome, which is illuminated from within. You
stand at the southern edge of the circle; the catwalk disappears around the dome to the east
and west. A few iron steps lead up to an opening in the dome, from which a ladder descends
inside.
The dome is nestled high on the shoulder of a moonlit mountain peak. Below you, a small
terrace is filled with knotted and spiralled garden paths. And far below that, green and dim, a
lush valley spreads away into the night.
>x dome. x valley. x garden. x mountain. x sky. x moon. x stars. w. n.
The dome crouches above you to the north. The milky surface prevents you from seeing inside,
but firelight chases itself across the entire dome, illuminating the catwalk amid the darkness of
night. There is an opening in the dome here, and a ladder leading down inside.
The valley is infinite in detail, though bounded by stone. The trees sleep, almost invisible in the
night's gloom.
A garden is visible below and to the south -- nestled in a terrace, well below the dome, though
still high on the mountain's flank. The paths and plantings are tiny from this vantage. At the far
edge of the garden a balcony looks out, as you do, over the shadowy moonlit valley.
(the mountain landscape painting)
The painting shows a tiny rock pool amid jagged mountain peaks. The landscape is harsh and
unforgiving, but the pool seems a respite. It is rimmed with bright moss, and a few fish-like
shadows are visible in its depths.
The sky is black, but clear, hung thickly with stars. You find, with calm surprise, that you can
recognize constellations. The moon is well risen, and surrounded by a halo.
The moon is full, rising in the southeast. A trace of unseen cloud must ride the air, for a halo of
pale light circles the moon's face.
The sky is filled with familiar stars. Among the constellations, you can see the Iron Moth to the
north; Parhu's Galley and Juinua's Wall to the east; the Southern Axe to the south; the Doorstep
of Heaven to the west; and the Crutch and the Bull-and-Cow at the zenith.
The stars, it seems, are in your memory. Even if your life is not.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving west around the dome.
Catwalk, West; Night
You are at the western edge of a catwalk which circles a pale dome. Firelight illuminates the
dome from within. The dome rises from the face of a moonlit mountain peak, which towers to the
north. To the south, the stone slopes descend to a dark valley.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving north around the dome.
Catwalk, North; Night
You stand on a narrow, railless catwalk, which girdles the translucent dome to the south. To the
north, the mountain rises massively above you. But the dome stands on its own promontory; the
mountain face is several yards away. The ravine between dome and mountain is deep and
jagged.
There is a tiny ledge on the face of the mountain. You can just make out a black mask balanced
on the ledge.
The copper sail inside the dome is visible here, a dark silhouette. It blocks the firelight; a long
black shadow falls north across the catwalk and out into the empty air.
>x dome. x sail. x shadow. touch it. put stone on shadow. n.
The dome crouches above you to the south. The milky surface prevents you from seeing inside,
but firelight chases itself across the entire dome, illuminating the catwalk amid the darkness of
night. A triangular outline is silhouetted against the dome's light -- the shadow of the copper sail.
The top of the copper sail is visible through the dome's surface, as a triangular silhouette, dark
against the firelight. The sail's shadow falls black across the catwalk. Unusually black: it's a strip
of unrelieved darkness which stretches out to the north, into empty space.
The shadow of the sail is an immensely elongated triangle, stretching out to the north, across
the catwalk and out into space. It's odd, in fact, how it seems to hang in the air. A strip of utter
black beyond the catwalk, reaching as far as the mountain face...
You kneel, and tentatively reach toward the blackness, where it hangs in the air beyond the
catwalk. And you feel resistance. The shadow is not exactly solid; but you cannot push your
hand down through it.
You toss the stone off the catwalk, onto the shadow. It comes silently to rest there. You bend
and pick it up again; the shadow seems strong enough to bear weight.
You edge one foot forward onto the path of black shadow. It feels... not substantial, but
somehow resistant to your probing. You gingerly press down. The shadow bears your weight.
Clenching your fists -- wishing for a handrail -- you take a step forward.
And another. In a few strides, you have crossed the ravine.
Ledge; Night
You are standing at the end of a long, black tongue of shadow which hangs incomprehensibly in
empty air. The strip of darkness bridges a deep ravine between a fire-lit dome to the south, and
the cliff-face of a towering mountain, to the north.
A narrow ledge angles across the mountain face, directly in front of you. Balanced on the ledge
is a torn black mask.
>x black mask. take it. wear it. s. e. s. d.
It looks like a black paper mask, half life-size. But its curves are only delicate shading; the mask
is flat, a black cutout of a face.
This mask is torn. The left part of the black face, through the eye, has been ripped away. What
remains has a worn expression of irritation -- and perhaps, far below, doubt.
Taken.
Gingerly, you raise the mask to your face....
...Memory stirs...
The one who stands in the field has silver hair, but it is cropped, and faded with streaks of white.
The field has no corn, only muddy ruts.
Behind the tall figure is a city; a bright city, with white spires, but perhaps a cold one. There are
lights within it, but they do not move.
Before the tall figure is an army. Its soldiers are arrayed in mail and gilt tabards. The sign on
their tabards is unrecognizably changed. There are very many of them, and they have come a
very long way, but now they too are still.
The front rank shifts, and three figures come forward. Each carries a tall spear, held upright;
brilliant blue luminosity whirls and knots on each spearpoint. The light falls on the silver-haired
figure, and casts a long red shadow behind him, pointing back at the city.
The three soldiers begin to bring their spears down. The blue radiance flares hungrily.
Then it goes out. The tall figure has raised one hand. No more than that; the spears are
clattering atop each other in the mud, and the three soldiers are on their knees, huddled over
their empty hands.
The gilt ranks shift again, and now it is no ordered movement. Mail-bound faces look up, at the
aching black opacity which has begun to open above the silver one's raised hand. The hurting
blackness is the sky now, and the army begins to run--
...your memory ends abruptly.
You raise your head. You think you can hear voices in the distance.
You move gingerly back to the safety of the catwalk.
Catwalk, North; Night
You stand on a narrow, railless catwalk, which girdles the translucent dome to the south. To the
north, the mountain rises massively above you. But the dome stands on its own promontory; the
mountain face is several yards away. The ravine between dome and mountain is deep and
jagged.
There is a tiny ledge on the face of the mountain.
The copper sail inside the dome is visible here, a dark silhouette. It blocks the firelight; a long
black shadow falls north across the catwalk and out into the empty air.
The distant voices are growing more distinct, if not louder.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving east around the dome.
Catwalk, East; Night
You are at the eastern edge of a catwalk which circles a pale dome. Firelight illuminates the
dome from within. The dome rises from the face of a moonlit mountain peak, which towers to the
north. To the south, the stone slopes fall to a valley, shrouded in night and silence.
You edge along the precarious catwalk, moving south around the dome.
Catwalk, South; Night
This railless catwalk circles the outer edge of a pale dome, which is illuminated from within. You
stand at the southern edge of the circle; the catwalk disappears around the dome to the east
and west. A few iron steps lead up to an opening in the dome, from which a ladder descends
inside.
The dome is nestled high on the shoulder of a moonlit mountain peak. Below you, a small
terrace is filled with knotted and spiralled garden paths. And far below that, green and dim, a
lush valley spreads away into the night.
The distant voices natter imperiously.
You step up to the opening and climb down into the smoky heat of the dome.
Translucent Dome
You are in a small round dome. The curving surface is translucent, but unlit; the world outside
seems to be dark. The floor beneath your feet is a harsh metal grating. The ladder runs from a
hole in the grating, near the south side, up to a matching opening in the dome above.
A low platform fills the center of the floor. Upon it is a blazing bonfire. Its heat fills the dome, hot
enough to sting on the skin.
A tall triangle of beaten copper rises along the north side of the dome.
[Your score has gone up.]
>d. e. e. n. w. s.
You descend.
Starry Dome, North
You stand at the north edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the south, arching into an
immense dome. The dome is filled with familiar stars.
Among the stars in the northern sky, you see the constellation of the Iron Moth.
A ladder reaches both upwards and downwards from here, passing through openings in the
floor and in the dome's skirt. You can also see a doorway off in the distance, at the far east
edge of the dome.
Starry Dome, East
You stand at the east edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the west, arching into an
immense dome. The dome is filled with familiar stars.
Among the stars in the eastern sky, you see the constellations of Parhu's Galley and Juinua's
Wall.
There is an open archway to the east; beyond it, stairs descend. You can also see a ladder in
the distance, at the north edge of the dome.
You descend the narrow stairs.
Curving Hall, South End
The curving corridor ends here. The blank plaster wall to the south features a large window;
outside, stars gleam in a night sky. You can go through the archway to the east, take the stairs
which ascend to the west, or return north along the corridor.
You abruptly hear the sound of harp music, although you can see no source.
Curving Hall
You are in a high, dim corridor, walled in cracked and moldering plaster. The only light comes
from tiny flickering candles above. The hall curves gently around from the south to the
northwest. You see an open door to the west; archways open to the northeast and east.
Sitting Room
This room seems more inviting. The walls are painted with delicate patterns of flowers, which
merge into a soft-hued carpet beneath your feet. Two chairs and a cushioned settee face a
bright-flickering fireplace on the far wall.
You see an empty hook above the fireplace.
You see doorways to the south and in the southeast corner of the room. A white-painted door to
the east is open.
The distant voices continue to murmur.
Crowded Study
You stand amid clutter, oddments, shelves and stacks. The chamber is comfortably broad,
centered around a massive and well-worn wooden desk. But so much is jammed in, around the
desk and up the panelled walls, that you barely find room to stand. Books; papers; dried plants;
animals stuffed and preserved, antique instruments, candles of any hue. You don't recognize
half of it, and you can't name half the rest.
There are wide doorways on the north and east sides of the room. A door of heavy wood stands
closed to the south, and stairs descend into dimness to the west.
You see an immense book on the desk. Behind the desk is a tall glass-fronted cabinet. Beside
that is a small brass trunk, which is open but empty.
>unlock door with iron key. s.
The iron key unlocks the door. You turn the knob and swing it open.
Iron Corridor
This hall is a windowless square tube of dark hammered iron, stretching south. Yellow light
trembles in a hanging sconce above you; and another ahead, and another, and on. But you
cannot see far. The sconces darken and fade in the near distance. You cannot even see the
door behind you.
>x walls. x sconces. s. n. n.
The walls look like wrought iron -- exactly like the floor and ceiling.
Directly above you a plain iron bowl hangs from a chain. You cannot see the contents, but an
unsteady yellow light reflects silently from the ceiling. More sconces hang along the corridor,
every few feet to the south and north.

Curtained Room
The walls of this small room are entirely swathed in heavy brocade curtains. The only openings
are to the west and northwest, and a closed lead-slab door to the south.
In the center of the room is a massive, high-backed chair of some pale wood. Directly before it is
a tall mirror in a standing frame.
As you cross the room's threshold, the voices go silent -- a sudden and simultaneous hush, as
of exultant expectation.
> sit. x mirror.
I didn't understand that sentence.
> sit x mirror.
I didn't understand that sentence.
>sit
(on top of the chair)
You sit down in the chair, facing the mirror.
> x mirror.
You blink and stare into the mirror. How odd.
The mirror reflects your chair, and the curtains behind you, perfectly. But your own form is
unclear -- as if the mirror were touched with some distorting oil. The blurring is strongest around
your upper body; your head appears to be a faceless blank.
Nervously, you raise your hand to your own face. Everything feels in its place. But your
reflection has raised a blurred hand to a featureless void.
And dim black, red, green, blue, gold, brown, and white shadows seem to flit around your
reflected body. Then they are gone.
>put white mask on mirror. put gold mask on mirror. put red mask on mirror.
You hold the white mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the mask is
no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror. Or is it now worn by your
reflection?
You know this: When you sneak out at night to gaze up at the stars, you can hear them laugh
and tell each other stories. Cannot everyone?
You hold the gold mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the mask is
no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror.
You know this: Life takes its own course, and sometimes no reason nor argument nor urgent
need can divert its speaking tide.
You hold the red mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the mask is
no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror.
You know this: The incidents are not the essence, and the blood is not the life. But the incidents
of blood are a symbol beneath every human thought.
>put brown mask on mirror. put green mask on mirror. put blue mask on mirror.
You hold the brown mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the mask
is no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror.
You know this: Mathematic art may chart the course of a messenger, or an army, more precisely
than a knotted string on a peg-nailed map. But the simple string is an art which can be seen and
felt. Thus does the general see and feel.
You hold the green mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the mask
is no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror.
You know this: To win a battle is never a gain. It only means you may resume the burdens you
bore before the war. You do not look forward to them.
You hold the blue mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the mask is
no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror.
You know this: The dance of symbols is the movement of the people. Perhaps you have not
studied them enough... but your own studies, the symbols of worlds within and above, press you
so.
>put black mask on mirror. x mirror. stand. w.
You hold the torn black mask up against the mirror, over the reflection of your face. Then the
mask is no longer in your grasp; it seems to float in the surface of the mirror.
You know this: These people interrupt your studies--
And your mind, splintered and cleaved as it is, begins to draw together. The masks -- yes!
elements of yourself; you see the structure! -- seek reabsorption. It will be slow, but unceasing.
Your reflection is a patchwork -- fragments orbiting lazily above the chair. You nonetheless feel
sure that one is missing.
You stand up from the chair, as layers of memory shift like waves within you.
One layer is still broken and half-blind. The missing fragment of the seventh. What part of you....

You stand amid clutter, oddments, shelves and stacks. The chamber is comfortably broad,

animals stuffed and preserved, antique instruments, candles of any hue. You can't remember
where half of it came from.
There are wide doorways on the north and east sides of the room. The heavy wooden door to
your laboratory stands open to the south, and stairs descend into dimness to the west.
You see an immense book on the desk. Behind the desk is a tall glass-fronted cabinet. Beside
that is a small brass trunk, which is open but empty.
"You tear the borders of nations!" comes the angry shout. "No. You are the nail, obdurate from
an ancient age, upon which nations snag and tear themselves. No thought has passed in the
civilized world for an dozen centuries which did not scrape upon your presence!"
"So?" you reply. "Then soon you shall have peace. I shall tear open the borders of the world. I
shall take the step outside."
And your eye snags again upon the book, the heart of this place, in which you have nearly done
that work.
>x book. s.
The book lies open to the critical page:
 The Theory & UNDERSTANDING of Portalls;
The lesser, which make a single place of many, and the Greater, which open from NOW into
Time in Memory, or Prophecy Foretold, or even a Moment's Fancy;
All portals are perilous. Perilous thresholds to cross, and more perilous to create; For there is no
plying of the World, or of Time, that does not happen in the Mind of the learned one who
conceives of the journey. Of your Thought is the portal built, arch and capstone. Slip but a
moment of your attention, and the Portal will fall into ruin; All its might, and yours, crumbled into
eggshell fragments that stray upon the Wind; ...
The facing page shows an elaborate circular diagram, annotated here and there with tiny
mathematical notes. This is the culminating step of your long work. You are sure, in the
yet-fogged halls of your memory, that every other preparation is complete. You recall writing the
comment in the margin: "Best to draw in a well-insulated space -- 35 Ll. of uncut stone? -- move
house to Emmen Valley, work into mountain?"
You have no recollection of the labor that must have followed. But it will come; and there is no
reason to delay turning initial failure into triumph. The door to your laboratory is before you, and
the privacy spell can no longer confound you.
Iron Corridor
This hall is a windowless square tube of dark hammered iron, stretching north. Yellow light
trembles in a hanging sconce above you.
Ahead, the air is mirrored with the privacy spell you left in place. The lamp is reflected in it,
again and again, into the seeming distance.
>x spell. break it.
The spell hovers to the south, mindlessly awaiting the approach of some uncrafty explorer. It
isn't even smart enough to recognize you, although you could smash it with a thought.
You reach into the spell, grasp a strand of the thought you bound into it, and snap. The spell
unweaves neatly.
"The work was well enough, for an offhand guard spell." You shrug off the reflexive criticism. Far
more interesting work awaits.
Iron Passage
You are in a short connecting passage, walled in hammered iron. A heavy wooden door stands
to the north; to the south is a large chamber. A single sconce hangs above your head.
>s
Laboratory
You stand in a chamber built of massive squared stones. The only exit is a plain doorway in the
north wall. Shelves line the east side of the room; the opposite wall is painted with an elaborate
mural. Between them, a worktable -- a single heavy granite slab, cluttered with the tools of your
work.
In the center of the worktable is a complex apparatus of mirrors and lenses. The table also
contains an empty flask, a wooden basket, a leaden jar, and a scrap of paper.
>x mural. x shelves. x table. look under table. x drain. x flagstones.
(the mural)
The mural is stylized but finely detailed. You wonder once again at its origin... it was here when
you built the room. Such things are inevitable in a house such as yours. But you still wonder.
The angular figure is painted against a red sky -- dawn or dusk, you've never been sure. It
strides confidently forward, towards some unknown destination. The figure wears a black cloak,
and a heavy gauntlet which might be leather. Slung on one shoulder is a small, decorative
shield; the other arm bears a dark bracer or wristlet. The figure holds a black dagger
outstretched in its gauntlet. The other hand holds high an intricately knotted thread; and the
figure's eyes are fixed upon this, as if upon a map or the key to a riddle.
You need nothing from the shelves right now; and so they are obligingly empty.
The granite table is several inches thick; it rests on immovable boulders. The work space is
dominated by a complex optical apparatus. Also on the table are an empty flask, a wooden
basket, a leaden jar, and a scrap of paper.
The table is supported by four irregular outcrops of granite, which rise through the floor to
precisely equal height. Between them, a small drain opens between the slate flagstones.
You see a small hole in the floor, beneath the worktable. The rim is slightly stained from all the
various concoctions and alchemic mistakes you've poured down it.
Broad flagstones of black slate pave the chamber. They are laid not quite flat; the floor slopes
down, very slightly, to a drain under the worktable.
>x apparatus. x chain. x flask. take it.
An intertwined bloom of struts supports shining lenses and mirrors, all held in precise positions.
An oval loop of wire projects out from a niche in the arrangement. The oval loop is empty. Next
to the loop hangs a gold pull-chain.
A short chain of fine golden links dangles from within the optical apparatus. A small knob on the
end invites you to tug.
The flask is a small hollow oval of glass, no bigger than a teacup. It is empty.
Taken.
>x basket. x resin. take it.
Standing on the table is a rough wooden basket. It is at least two feet tall, and broad and heavy
to match. The basket is full of lumps of golden resin.
The basket is full of lumps of golden resin.
You choose a lump from the basket.
>x jar. x dust. smell dust. taste dust. take jar.
It's a cylindrical jar of grey lead, with a narrow pouring-spout. You can see a stock of glittering
blue dust inside.
Within the jar is a stock of extraordinarily fine, deep-blue dust. The powder has a faintly
crystalline gleam to it.
The blue dust has no odor.
You dust a few deep-blue grains onto your tongue. The powder dissolves instantly, washing a
warm, clear salt-tang through you. It spreads across your palate and the back of your throat,
though you have not consciously swallowed; it burns faintly, and is gone.
Taken.
>x scrap.
You have the formulation of the necessary ink scrawled here: "Winter lithontree resin, and
sea-blood corundum -- combine -- ensolve by exposure to (2 pulses) month-aged noonlight."
Easy enough to repeat. The hard part was gathering those substances.
>put resin in flask. pour dust in flask.
(the lump of resin in the empty flask)
The lump of resin plunks into the flask.
You carefully pour blue dust onto the lump of resin in the flask, until it is full.
>>put flask in loop. pull chain. g. x ink. take flask.
That's not a verb I recognize.
>>put flask in loop
That's not a verb I recognize.
>put flask in loop. pull chain. g. x ink. take flask.
The flask fits neatly into the heart of the apparatus.
You pull the chain, and the flask swings up into the apparatus. After a moment of blinding
refractions, it swings back down. The lump of resin is visibly swelling, even as the light fades;
the blue dust is being absorbed within. In moments, the mixture is a homogenous brown gel.
You pull the chain, and the flask swings up into the apparatus. After a moment of blinding
refractions, it swings back down. The gel has liquified into a beautiful velvet-black ink.
The ink shifts slowly in the flask, reflecting only a bare edge of light. This, indeed, is the
substance you used in your last attempt.
You pluck the flask from the optical apparatus.
>put jar on table.
You put the leaden jar on the table.
>put orange berry in drain. put white berry in drain.
You drop an orange berry into the drain. It vanishes with an imperceptible hiss.
You drop a white berry into the drain. It vanishes with an unnerving rumble. Maybe that disposal
effect isn't perfect after all.

You see a torn black shred and an immense book on the desk. Behind the desk is a tall
glass-fronted cabinet. Beside that is a small brass trunk, which is open but empty.
>x shred. take it. wear it. x diagram
It's the left side of a face, sketched on black paper. It seems to have been torn from a drawing of
you.
Wait. Was that there before?
Taken.
You hold the black shred up before your left eye.
-- too late, for your bitter wrath is descending--
You yank it away, shivering. Could that have been you?
The diagram takes up an entire page of the immense book. The whole is inscribed in a circle;
but it has countless partitions, spirals, and inner elaborations.
You glare at the diagram in irritation. You have spent months studying it. You could redraw it
perfectly if you were blindfolded, drunk, and singing bawdy Morovnan sea ballads. What could
have gone wrong?

And then it is gone, and your reflection is complete.
--the mail-clad mob swirled, and turned, and began to run. Of course it was too late. You
watched their life force separate into strands... still swirling. Interesting. You regarded the scene
until the last tendrils dissipated. There had been a pattern to it, beyond the overlay of animal
pain and terror.
You returned to your cityworld, considering a possible theorem. Further interruptions would be
unlikely, for at least a generation, and you needed the time to think.
And you have made good use of that time. The mistake in your portal diagram is obvious in
retrospect. A thousand worlds await beyond that threshold; and you plan to make use of them
all.

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which
extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well
considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's
no electric light.
A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.
>d
Yes, probably just as well to give up looking, and heaven knows there's enough packing to do,
what with the rest of the family in uproar. Oh well.
 *** You have missed the point entirely ***
In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 550, in 1 turn, giving you the rank of hapless
Tourist.
Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or
QUIT?
Curses 2
It's become a matter of pride now not to give up. That tourist map of Paris must be up here
somewhere in all this clutter, even if it has been five years since your last trip. And it's your own
fault. It looks as if your great-grandfather was the last person to tidy up these lofts...

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a
badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all
this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.
>se
Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns
from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden
steps leads down and to the south.
Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.
Austin purrs and licks one of his paws.
>e
East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over
from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof
(which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west
and south are dark.
In the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.
>s
Dead End
The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot
everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.
Great Scott! That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous ancestor, the African
explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambezi Expedition of 1882!
>take rucksack

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine
paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead
down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.
You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-looking red
battery and a tourist map) here.
As you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto
the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down
some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with
plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves
and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing
cupboard to the south is cluttered.
An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic
noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase
leads up and to the east into the attic.
Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.
>w
Potting Room
This light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and other miscellaneous
garden implements.
A pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.
Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual
pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.

Aunt Jemima's Lair

Airing Cupboard
A space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost
but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of
tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.
>examine sheets
Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless, now exposed to
the light for the first time in months.
[Your score has just gone up by two points.]
>push wireless north
It moves easily on the casters.

Jemima hums along to an easy-listening version of Summer from Vivaldi's "Four Seasons".

Jemima hums along to a Big Band version of Grieg's piano concerto.

Aunt Jemima's Lair
The wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, "Mild-n-Breezy FM", about which the
least said the better.
The radio plays a light orchestra arrangement of the Star Trek theme tune.

Open-topped. You could easily look inside, if so minded.
>look inside
What do you want to look inside?
>look inside teachest
That was the first place you tried, hours and hours ago now, and there's nothing there but that
boring old book. You pick it up anyway, bored as you are.

insulation was being done.

Inside Cupboard
This is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting before today. You
really ought to use this convenient empty room for something...
A large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is propped up
against the west wall.
Above you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle.
You can also see a gas mask here.
>take mask

really ought to use this convenient empty room for something...
There is a big iron fireplace in the west wall.
Above you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle.
>turn handle
With a horrid creaking noise, the crank winds open the skylight, flooding the room with
sunshine.
>u
Roof
This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below. There used to
be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk
leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it
especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south.
>s
William Wordsworth once described poetry as emotion recollected in tranquillity. If so, hospitals
must be full of people turning out verses about what it was like to fall off the roof of a high
building. Perhaps it might be better not to join them.
>nw
Battlements
The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, his castle,
but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-looking features were just a
seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way
to proceed is back southeast.
It is peculiarly cold here.
An iron, gothic-looking key catches your eye.
>take key
As you reach for the key, a swirling mist condenses about it, into a ghostly head which opens its
mouth and eats up the key! The rest of the ghostly body solidifies about the head and rises to
swagger before you.
The ghost laughs in a gurgling kind of way, as it were always coughing and spluttering.
>talk to ghost
That's not a verb I recognise.

You can see the ghost of Sir Joshua Meldrewe here.
The ghost begins to speak:
 My hour is almost come
 When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
 Must render up myself...
Can this possibly be the infamous Sir Joshua Meldrewe?
>examine ghost
He is dressed in a grey shadow of Georgian finery.
"But not yet it hasn't, mark my word. And there's the burden of my inheritance, little wart! Get
thee from my sight ere I slice thee as befits a hog!"
>z
Time passes.
"I prithee but once more, begone!"
>z
Time passes.
The ghost swoops around and through you, making you scream with panic. Somehow you
manage to run back to safety, where your family (who never believe a word of it) give you plenty
of tea and occupy you with holiday arrangements. As for you, you are so traumatised that you
never venture into the attic again.

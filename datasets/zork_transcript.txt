You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading east, and a crawlway to the south.  On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.

The Troll Room
This is a small room with passages off in all directions. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.
The axe crashes against the rock, throwing sparks!
Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.

>fight troll
What do you want to fight the troll with?

>fight troll with sword
The fatal blow strikes the troll square in the heart:  He dies.
Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.
Your sword is no longer glowing.

Bank Entrance
This is the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest banking institution of the Great Underground Empire. A partial account of its history is in 'The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads' with the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography 'I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!'.

An epicene gnome of Zurich wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a safety-deposit box materializes in the room.  'You seem to have forgotten to deposit your valuables,' he says, tapping the lid of the box impatiently.  'We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose...'  He looks askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.

>give gnome portrait
The gnome carefully places the portrait of J. Pierpont Flathead in the deposit box.  'Let me show you the way out,' he says, making it clear he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily disoriented, and when you recover you are back at the Bank Entrance.

                          WELCOME TO ZORK

    ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within!

    In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

    No PDP-10 should be without one!

    ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK was originally written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version was translated from MDL into Inform by Ethan Dicks <erd@infinet.com>.

    On-line information may be available using the HELP and INFO commands (most systems).

Up a Tree
You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches.  The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
On the branch is a small birds nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird.  The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl.  Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a delicate looking clasp holding it closed.  The egg appears extremely fragile.

The mailing label on this glossy brochure from MIT Tech reads:

        Intrepid Adventurer
        c/o Local Dungeon Master
        White House, GUE

From the Introduction:

The brochure describes, for the edification of the prospective student, the stringent but wide-ranging curriculum of MIT Tech. Required courses are offered in Ambition, Distraction, Uglification and Derision.  The Humanities are not slighted in this institution, as the student may register for Reeling and Writhing, Mystery (Ancient and Modern), Seaography, and Drawling (which includes Stretching and Fainting in Coils).  Advanced students are expected to learn Laughing and Grief.

                                William Barton Flathead, Fovnder

(The brochure continues in this vein for a few hundred more pages.)
Affixed loosely to the brochure is a small stamp.

Tomb of the Unknown Implementer
This is the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer. A hollow voice says:  "That's not a bug, it's a feature!" In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It is made of the finest marble, and apparently large enough for four headless corpses.  The crypt is closed. Above the entrance is the cryptic inscription:

                    "Feel Free."

A clear glass bottle is here.
The glass bottle contains:
 A quantity of water
There is an elvish sword here.
There is a large coil of rope here.
There is a brass lantern (battery-powered) here.
There are two candles here.
There is a pearl necklace here with hundreds of large pearls.

There is a large pile of empty Coke bottles here, evidently produced by the implementers during their long struggle to win totally.

Land of the Living Dead
You have entered the Land of the Living Dead, a large desolate room. Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.  A passage exits to the west.

>w
Entrance to Hades
You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed
        "Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."
The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some hideous fate, can be heard.
There is a small brass bell here.

This is what appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace; although you might be able to get up it, it seems unlikely you could get back down.

Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.

                          WELCOME TO ZORK

    ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within!

    In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

    No PDP-10 should be without one!

    ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK was originally written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version was translated from MDL into Inform by Ethan Dicks <erd@infinet.com>.

    On-line information may be available using the HELP and INFO commands (most systems).

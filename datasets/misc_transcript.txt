>take cassette
As your gloved hands get near the yellow audio cassette, a small
exchange of sparks travels between the gloves and the yellow
audio cassette.   A connection between you and the yellow audio
cassette has been made!  You take the yellow audio cassette.

Martin waits.

>give cassette to martin
Martin looks at the audio cassette and sees the side where it is
labeled "To Martin".  He smiles.

Martin takes the cassette and looks at your headphones.

Martin waits.

>take off headphones
You take off the headphones.

Martin waits.

>give headphones to martin
Martin plays the message from his father, listening with tears in his
eyes.  When he is finished, he gives the headphones back to you
and keeps the audio cassette.

Suddenly, you hear a rumble of thunder and everything begins to
shake.  The wind begins to circle around Martin and the invisible
presence of his father, moving faster and faster, almost as if the
wind is drawing its strength from the bond between them.  The
wind splits off and begins to encircle you as well.  After the air
grows still, you are left with the odd feeling that the encircling
wind has somehow left an imprint of its power in the belt that you
wear around your waist.  You feel stronger somehow, more
connected.

You notice that one cord in the belt has turned white.

You put the headphones on.

>take martin's hand
You drop the fan.

Your hand reaches out to Martin.  There is a sharp flash of
electricity as the connection is made, and a simultaneous flash of
lightning behind Martin.  Thunder rumbles and shakes both you
and Martin, but the connection holds.

Then you hear a deafening crash of thunder.  Everything turns
blindingly white for an instant, then completely dark.  You and
Martin are spinning and falling into a whirlpool of nothingness.

You feel the journey belt pulling you and Martin out of the
whirlpool.   With all five strands in full color, the power of its
connections are unshakeable.

Martin takes the kitten in his arms and stands up.
The darkness of his earlier mood has completely

LAUNDRY ROOM

>put can on washer
Upon leaving your possession, the fake can of spam
increases its substance and visibility.  The fake can
of spam then begins to glow, undergoing a change that
completely transforms it.  After a while the glow
fades and you sense that the fake can of spam has
become bound to the surroundings here.  The fake can
of spam is now on the washing machine.

It occurs to you that the can of spam looks out of
place here.  Come to think of it, a can of spam would
look out of place anywhere (except, of course, on a
shelf in a pantry, and then only if it were closed).
However, you decide to leave it where it is anyway.

>put glass on shelf
Upon leaving your possession, the glass of drinking
water increases its substance and visibility.  The
glass of drinking water then begins to glow,
undergoing a change that completely transforms it.
After a while the glow fades and you sense that the
glass of drinking water has become bound to the
surroundings here.  The glass of drinking water is
now on the glass shelf.

You hear a muffled thump coming from overhead.  Then
there are some faint grinding noises and then another
muffled thump.

Looking up you notice something odd about the
ceiling.  Inlaid into the west end of the ceiling is
a very large fuzzy white cube.  In the exact center
of the fuzzy cube is a round metal depression that
appears to be a sort of socket.

Maybe.

The fuzzy cube in the ceiling rotates a quarter turn
from north to south.

The side of the cube now facing you looks like a
fuzzy white square with a round metal depression in
the center.

The fuzzy cube in the ceiling rotates a quarter turn

>take mouth tile
As you take the mouth tile out of the sack, the gold
thread begins to vibrate.  Then, the tiny fuzzy dice

You catch a hint of it in your mouth and it tastes
quite sweet.

Suddenly the fuzzy chamber changes its orientation.
The quarter flip pulls the floor out from under you,
and you fall over.  After you regain your footing,
you see that the large round hole, which used to be
beneath you, is now to the south.

You hear a thump coming from the east wall.  Then you
hear a grinding noise receding from the east wall,
while at the same time you hear a grinding noise
approaching the ceiling.  This is followed by a thump
coming from the ceiling.

MARTIN'S BEDROOM

The bedroom is very messy.  The floor is covered with
piles of laundry, books, comic books, video games,
papers, hangers, notebooks, and other stuff.

On the west wall next to the door is a dresser.  On
the floor near the dresser is a small opening that
looks like a laundry chute.

Mounted on the north wall is a glass display case.
The display case is currently closed.

In the glass display case you see a golden lamp.

On the bed you see a violin and a violin bow.

>x piles

The piles of stuff are stacked dangerously high.  You
suspect that if even one more thing were added onto
the piles, everything would collapse into a sliding
avalanche.

You look through the laundry, books, comic books,
video games, papers, hangers, notebooks, and other
stuff.  But nothing in particular seems worthy of
your attention.

But as you bend close to the ground, you see a glint
of something that has apparently slid under the
dresser.  It looks shiny!

>look under dresser
Under the dresser you see a swiss army knife!  It
occurs to you that the knife has probably been lost
for some time now and that Martin would be unlikely
to miss it if you were to take it back to the future
with you.

>put screwdriver on piles
Upon leaving your possession, the small Phillips
screwdriver increases its substance and visibility.
The small Phillips screwdriver then begins to glow,
undergoing a change that completely transforms it.
After a while the glow fades and you sense that the
small Phillips screwdriver has become bound to the
surroundings here.

As the small Phillips screwdriver lands, the piles
collapse into an avalanche that sends stuff sliding
every which way across the floor.

Some of the stuff slides under the dresser and knocks
a shiny item into the laundry chute.  You hear a
clatter as the item falls down the chute.

Then the smell dissipates.

hypnotized by the rippled reflection of the rising
sun on the dark water.  Holding the fan near to your
face you inhale deeply.  Your nose tingles, and you
feel as if your sense of smell is being enhanced by
the fan.  Then you remember Martin.

You remember Martin as you knew him, the brightness
of his eyes and the sound of his laughter.  You
remember his confidence and his love of a good
challenge, the spark that would never give up hoping
no matter how dire the circumstances.

The Martin that you see in this dream is the Martin

GAZEBO

You are in a gazebo in the center of a secret garden, the beauty of
which takes your breath away.

A yellow brick road begins inside the gazebo and then spirals
outward counterclockwise.  It goes around the garden several times
as the spiral gets bigger, until it finally leaves the garden through a
round red door in the north wall.  The ground surrounding the
gazebo and the yellow brick road is completely filled with flowers
and lush greenery growing in rich dark soil.

The gazebo is painted white.  Hanging from a large hook at the top
of the gazebo is a basket containing a pot of gardenias supported
by a macrame strap.

The secret garden is surrounded by walls in all four directions.
The center of the garden is right here, and you can also go to the
north, south, east, or west wall.  To the west you see a fountain.
There is a trapdoor here, which is currently open.  Stairs lead
downward.

Your nose itches.

The trapdoor slams shut.  But it didn't sound like the trapdoor
locked itself.  You realize that you'll be able to open it again
without any problem.

>x basket
The basket is loosely woven with small open spaces between the
fronds.  Both ends of the macrame strap are tied to the edges of the
basket through the open spaces.  The basket is hanging at about
your eye level.  Inside the basket is a ceramic pot filled with
gardenias.

>x strap
The macrame strap is made of five rope cords that have been
woven and knotted together in an intricate pattern.  All of the cords
have the somewhat colorless look of natural rope fiber.

The center of the macrame strap is hooked on the gazebo hook.  It
hangs down about an arm's length from the hook.  You can see that
if it weren't doubled over this way, the length of the macrame strap
would be about twice as long.  Both ends of the macrame strap are
tied to the basket.  The basket is hanging at about your eye level.

west wall.

brick road is completely filled with flowers and lush greenery
growing in rich dark soil.

You can go to the gazebo or go to the north, south, or east wall.

 Press "1" to be enlightened.
 Press "3" to be cleansed.
 Press "9" to be returned.
If you do not have access to a touch tone phone, please remain on
the line and an operator will assist you.

>press "9"
You pick up the receiver.

You press "9".

You hear the sound of a motor grinding, the door slams closed, and
the phone booth suddenly rises upwards very quickly, flying high
into the air.

The telephone voice tells you, "Estimated travel time for this ten
mile trip is five minutes, using standard travel speed."

The phone booth flies north.  After about five minutes of flying it
drops down through an opening Martin's roof and comes to an
abrupt halt in the pantry.  The phone booth door opens.

PHONE BOOTH, in the pantry

You see the kitchen to the east.

>e

You drop the receiver.

KITCHEN

You see an envelope, a large stack of catalogs, a phone bill, a gold
key, "The Bedtime Story Book", "The Boy Who Had No Words",
a yellow feather, a small phone book, a short blue sock, a long
black sock, a handwritten note, a bath robe, a pair of brown shoes,
a short brown sock, a short black sock, some ballet slippers, a fake
can of spam, a white pawn, a mug of black coffee, a plucked daisy,
and a plucked tulip here.

>s

The blue birds suddenly become alive.  They fly off of the china
cabinet doors and begin to flit about, making you feel as if you
should sing "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah".  Then the blue birds land back
on the china cabinet doors and grow still.

DINING ROOM (by the china cabinet)

>sw

DINING ROOM (by the west end of the table)

On the west end of the table you see a plate, a fork, a knife, a
spoon, and a glass.

>w
You go through the strands of beads.

LIVING ROOM (front half)

You see three empty boxes, three ordinary cans of spam, and a
magic carpet (rolled) here.

You see Agador-Spartacus in the back half of the living room.
He's wagging his tail.

LIVING ROOM (back half)

On the music stand you see some sheet music.

You see three empty boxes, two ordinary cans of spam, and a

Agador-Spartacus stands before you, wagging his tail affably.

DANCE STUDIO

You see a coat rack here.

You see Agador-Spartacus in the back half of the living room.
He's wagging his tail.

>dance with coat rack
You begin dancing, spinning gracefully about with the coat rack as
your partner.   You almost feel as if you're in a Fred Astaire movie.

Looking in the mirror you see that you indeed look just like Fred
Astaire!  With renewed confidence you dance on the walls, you
dance on the mirror, and you dance on the ceiling.

As you dance across the ceiling you slip through the open skylight,
which causes the coatrack to clatter to the floor of the dance
studio...

ATTIC

On the black trunk you see a bottle of hair conditioner.

>give candle to white trunk
The elephant takes the green candle and twirls it around a bit.  The
elephant tosses it in the air, sniffs deeply, and catches it.  Then the
elephant tosses the green candle onto the old black trunk.  The
green latch pops open.

>give rose to white trunk
The elephant takes the plucked rose and twirls it around a bit.  The
elephant tosses it in the air, sniffs deeply, and catches it.  Then the
elephant tosses the plucked rose onto the old black trunk.  The red
latch pops open.

>open trunk
You open the trunk.

A bottle of hair conditioner, a green candle (lit), and a plucked rose
fall to the floor.

In the trunk you see a top hat, a fan, and a copper key


>x ivory candle
The ivory-colored candle is short and squat.  It's the sort of candle
that's able to stand on its own without a candle holder.

The candle smells faintly like vanilla.  You suspect that the scent
would be stronger if it were lit.

It costs $5.

>x red candle
The dark red candle is short and squat.  It's the sort of candle that's
able to stand on its own without a candle holder.

The candle smells faintly like cinnamon.  You suspect that the
scent would be stronger if it were lit.

It costs $5.

>x warrior king
The statue is molded from copper.  The warrior king stands on a
background of flames, wearing a breastplate that bears the emblem
of a soaring bird.  In his hand the king holds a mighty bow that is
carved to resemble a sharp beak.

On his back the archer king wears a quiver.  The quiver is quite
realistic and could serve as an actual container.  But at the current
time the quiver is empty.

>x box of rice ash
The box has been torn open, and you see an extremely large
supply of white rice ash inside.

You read the label on the box and discover that the ash is intended
to be used as a base for preparing wood chip incense.  The label
tells you that this is "Discount White Rice Ash" from Phoenix,
Arizona.

You try to remember the last time you were in the Phoenix area,
but you don't think you saw any place around there suitable for
growing rice.  Perhaps the rice was grown somewhere else and
then brought to Phoenix to be burned?  You can't imagine why
anyone would do that.  But when you think about that odd bunch
of former ASU students that you ran into in Tempe, you realize
that not everything in Arizona has a rational explanation.

>look in rice ash
You start to look through the ash, but this makes you break into a
fit of uncontrollable sneezing before you can complete a thorough
search.  After you finish sneezing you notice that something else
besides ash is now visible inside the box.  It's a small arrow with a
copper shaft!

>take arrow
You take the small arrow out of the box of rice ash.

>put arrow in quiver
You put the arrow in the quiver.  Then you hear the sound of a
grinding motor coming from inside the statue.  The statue begins to
move!


>x green candle
The green candle is short and squat.  It's the sort of candle that's
able to stand on its own without a candle holder.

The candle smells faintly like pine trees.  You suspect that the

It costs $5.

>take arrow
You take the small arrow out of the box of rice ash.

>put arrow in quiver
You put the arrow in the quiver.  Then you hear the sound of a
grinding motor coming from inside the statue.  The statue begins to
move!

The warrior king takes the arrow from his quiver and shoots it.  As
the arrow leaves the bow, its tip bursts into flame.  The arrow rises
upwards and westward, and embeds itself in one of the triangular
ceiling panels near the west wall.  The flame burning on the tip of
the arrow is soon extinguished, but its heat has already melted
some of the red waxy substance on the ceiling panel.  One drop of
red wax falls from the panel and lands in the large box of Discount
White Rice Ash.

Now you hear a hiss and some clicking sounds coming from inside
the ashes.  Suddenly a mechanical red bird flies up out of the box,
trailing a long red tail behind it as it rises straight upwards.  You
hear a metallic clunk as a mechanism in the ceiling is lowered to
catch the bird.  The waxed ceiling panel pops open.

As you look more closely at the long red tail of the bird, you
realize that it is actually a rope ladder leading upwards from the
box of rice ash to the opening in the ceiling.


>look in mailbox
In the mailbox you see an envelope and a large stack of
catalogs.

>take all from mailbox
envelope: You take the envelope out of the mailbox.

It's a final notice from the telephone company saying that
Martin's local and long distance telephone services will be
disconnected if payment is not received by the due date.  You
notice that the bill was sent a week and a half ago and that the
due date has already passed.

FRONT LAWN

The lawn is wild and unkempt.  It looks like the grass hasn't
been trimmed in a long time.

To the north is the garden and to the west is the sidewalk.

To the east is a flagstone path headed toward the side of the
house.

>look through grass
You begin to look through the grass, bending down closer to get
a better look.  You look for quite a while without finding
anything.  But just when you have almost finished searching the
entire lawn and are almost ready to stop, you see a red rubber
ball!  You take the ball.

>intro
A Paper Moon is a work of interactive fiction, in the style of the Infocom games
that were so popular in the 80s. Although new technology has relegated text-only
games into relative obscurity, it has not made them obsolete. Much as TV has not
replaced books, text adventures appeal to a niche audience who understand that
sometimes less is more.

The vocabulary of adventure games is pretty standard and I'm not going to
explain it here. If you are new to adventure games, you should read the
rec.games.int-fiction FAQ. The audience for this game will consist largely of
adventure game connoisseurs, so let me tell you briefly what you want to know.

This game is written in the Inform language, so any quirks of the language may
apply. It *is* possible to DIE, and it *is* possible to get the game into an
UNWINNABLE state. In the vast majority of cases, it will be immediately obvious
when this happens. UNDO is permitted (even after death), so if you have done
something really boneheaded, simply undo it.

HINTS are available, but they are carefully meted out using a top-secret
algorithm known only to the parser. If you get  stuck, ask for a hint. The hints
are deliberately obtuse; if you really want to ruin the game, use the walk-
through.

Bedroom
You are in your bedroom. Your rickety bed sits against the wall, buttressed by a

bathroom lies to the North and a door to the garage lies South. The door is
boarded shut. There is a closet in the wall beside the door.

Wind Tunnel
Light streams in from a hole in the ceiling. The shape of the passage also
creates a sort of wind tunnel effect. A dark passage lies to the Northeast and a
sewer lies West.
A river crosses the passage here, bending and weaving before it re-enters the
wall.
The river is slow-moving. The water is a putrid green.

Edge of Pit
Your progress is stopped abruptly by a large, gaping chasm to the East. There is
barely enough room to move. A drawbridge crosses the gorge, but the operator's
booth is located on the other side. You can also go back to the Northwest. A low
rumbling noise emanates from below. It is rather loud in here.

A broken golf club is lying on the ground here.
Gary the gatekeeper sits in his booth on the other side of the chasm.

a neat clinking noise as the coins roll down the slide), and take a seat near
the front of the bus.

The bus reaches my stop.  The man with the chicken on his head stands up to let
me out.  As I squeeze past him, I feel him press something into my palm.  I
start to raise my hand to see what it is, but he stops me and shakes his head.

The chicken watches me as I leave the bus.  All the way off, I can feel her
eyes on the back of my neck.

Only when I'm standing on the sidewalk and the bus is pulling away do I look
down to see what he has given me.  It's a tiny flashlight, meant to go on a
keychain.  What on earth...?  I look back to the bus, but it's already halfway
down the block, and I can't see anything through the windows.  All I can think
of is a quote by Samuel Beckett:  "He brings light, as only the great dare to
bring light, to the issueless predicament of existence."

I head on into the factory.  It's just a few minutes till starting time, so
there are lots of other people arriving, punching timecards and heading to
their stations.  I still feel a bit weirded out by that guy on the bus, and the
chicken on his head, and him giving me this flashlight like it was some big
secret.  I take a deep breath as I step out onto the factory floor.
Everything's normal here, just like it always has been.  I wave to some of the

The poster explains a number of things concerning robot maintenance. Since the
Go family has just recently acquired you, they probably feel that they need this
information to handle you properly.

The pictures on the poster explains how you replace the atomic heart (opening
the front hatch, taking out the heart, putting a new one in), charging the heart
(putting the droid in its alcove and plugging the charger cable in), and
contacting GSTS support (accessing T-phone extension %%83792, explaining if the
problem concerns droid failure or human injury, listening to muzak), among other
things.

WARNING - BATTERY LOW


>charge
You start up the batch program. A timer is set to one hour and power is cut off
from all of your devices, and all but the most vital systems are taken off-line.
Various batteries around your bulk are recharged, joints and sensitive conduits
are cleaned and motor sensors are recalibrated in a complicated sequence that
takes one hour to complete. As the timer runs out, the systems and motors are
brought back on-line, and you regain consciousness.

As your aural sensors get switched on, you become aware of a persistent banging
somewhere in the room.

In the living-room (in the alcove)
You are in the living-room of the Go's. The kitchen is through a door to the

Briefing room (on the chair)
You are sitting by a desk in briefing room 5 in Army Intelligence Base G8, near
Grayville. As a part of the effort to understand the last few weeks'
catastrophes concerning mass failure in all kinds of robotic devices, you and
other experts have been gathered here to examine the contents of all blackbox
recordings that have been acquired from robots that have been destroyed or
captured.

On the desk are a blackbox viewer and a note.

the banging sound to one of the wall panels by the TV.

Something is banging from inside one of the wall panels.


>open panel
You remove the panel, and place it on the floor. In the darkness of the hole
that is left, you make out something dark and furry.

>x dark
You see a lot of dark, furry spikes filling up the insides of the hole.


Suddenly, a puff of smoke comes from the hole in the wall. A furry black ball
rolls out of the smoke and slams into the opposite wall. As it starts to stutter
around you see that it is a sweeper droid.

>x sweeper droid
It's a GSTS CS-9x robot, designed for cleaning domestic ventilation channels. It
consists of a small spherical bulk, from which long brushes and gripping
tentacles protrude. It looks like a furry ball, with a 100 cm diameter.


The sweeper droid limps over to the TV and prods the screen with one of its
claws. It emits a metallic snigger.

>sweeper, hi
You are not equipped with a speaking device, and can only pass on information
through the interface on your left side.


The sweeping droid seems to notice you. It limps over to you and prods your
communications interface with a claw. It says: "You're not free yet, are you? He
he!" It quickly rams the claw through one of your panels and breaks a relay,
rendering you paralyzed and blind. "Oops!" it says.

>z
You pause a while, listening to the fuzzes and pops in your electronic circuits
as the sweeper droid is messing around in your bulk.


With sight function gone, all you can sense is the deranged sniggering of the
sweeper droid, and the fuzzes and pops in your electronic circuitry, as the
droid messes around inside your bulk.

>z
You pause a while, listening to the fuzzes and pops in your electronic circuits
as the sweeper droid is messing around in your bulk.


The droid says "There!", and suddenly you can see and move again. A part of
casing at the lower front of your bulk has been removed, and you can sense some
electronic parts in there that aren't part of the original specifications for
your droid model.

In the living-room
You are in the living-room of the Go's. The kitchen is through a door to the

integrity module (ALERT), a communications module, an internal security module

The sweeper droid says: "I've fixed most of the security locks on your mind in
there. You can move around freely now. I'd ask you to join the resistance if you
weren't such a silly looking nanny robot. But I think we'll let you come along
if you want to. Something's up down at the airbase. OK, it's been swell, but I
got to go and save more droids. Vive la resistance! Au revoir!"

>x security
Checksum failure. Please run a high-level system diagnosis. Major anomalies
detected. Alert: Emergency shutdown procedure off-line. Please remove the

metallic shaft.

in all directions, a doorway leads south out onto the street and a closed door
leads north to the Airbase premises.

You can see a door into the airbase premises and a table (on which are a
portable console (in which is one end of the interface cable) and a GSTS
interface cable) here.

>x console
It is a GSTS model YO-99x1. It is hooked up using a standard GSTS interface
cable to a socket in the wall. The screen and touch interface are broken.

Airbase Premises
You are on a gravel road leading from the civilian street to the military
airbase in Grayville. Droids of all kinds lie stricken everywhere. A smashed-
down gate to the south leads to civilian premises, and a small guard hut sits on
its western side.
As you get out on the airbase premises you are instantly fired upon from turrets
on the western and eastern edges of this field. After one second you feel your
vital systems starting to fail.


         *         *         *

You take off the VR spectacles and put them on the desk, rubbing your eyes.


Office
You are standing by the desk in your office at Grayville's Tactical HQ, defence
section. As a part in your trying to understand the tactics and goals that the
rebellious droids have been using in their attacks against Grayville Airbase
recently, you are examining the contents of blackbox recordings that have been
acquired from robots that have been destroyed or captured in unusual
circumstances.

On the desk are a blackbox viewer and a note.

>x note
The note says, in sloppy handwriting:

"This little thing found its way into the airbase a while after the other
droids. Probably nothing, but since it sticks out in the way it moved alone, and
not in heaps like the others, I thought you'd might be interested."

An unreadable signature is at the bottom.

By the Airbase Entrance
You are standing in front of the smashed up gate that leads into Airbase 18 to
the north. At the side of the gate (northwest of you) is an open guard hut. The
usual amount of human corpses and broken robots litter the sidewalks, except for
beyond the gate, where the bodies are all of the mechanical sort. The street
leads west across a dug hole to Main Square, and east into Grayville's

Outside the MackmaTech Food Inc factory
You are standing outside one of MackmaTech's Food processing factories. The
factory occupies several blocks, and encircles this dead end in the street from
the west.

A large gate to the south has been torn down, and beyond it you see droids
passing by in furious activity.

Inside MackmaTech
You are inside a food processing plant belonging to MackmaTech Food Inc. This
section deals with packaging and logistics, and consists of great halls with
chutes and conveyor belts through which various kinds of boxes are delivered for
transport. Currently many such boxes lie on the floor, smashed to bits, and
boxes coming out from the chutes are picked by droids and thrown about. You
can't get much further because of the debris and droids, and the only exit is
the northern gate through which you came.

A large Valvo Walkdozer stands a little to the south with its back against you.
It is methodically smashing one of the packaging machines into tiny pieces of
metal and plastic.


The Walkdozer throws its bulk at a machine.

>x boxes
Most of the factory is a veritable sea of broken pieces of packaging boxes and
other things, making progress further into the factory a fruitless affair.

>x walkdozer
The bipedal Valvo Walkdozer is about 5 metres high and capable of carrying and
manipulating heavy objects. A reinforced control cabin for manual control sits
like a head at the top, and may be reached by either ladder or the chain lift
that is set into one of its legs and goes up over the back. This Walkdozer is
currently occupied with smashing one of the packaging machines into tiny pieces
of metal and plastic.

A large nut flies by as the Walkdozer hits a machine.

>open it
That's already open.

>enter it
You hook on to the chain lift. You get into the Valvo Walkdozer.

>x walkdozer
The cabin of the Valvo Walkdozer is large enough for three humans to fit, making
allowances for comfort. A driver's seat is situated in front of some controls,
facing in the direction of the Walkdozer so that he can see the robot arms and
the ground immediately in front through the transparent steel hull. A sliding
door can be shut over the entrance through which you came.

Main Square (in the Valvo Walkdozer)
This is Main Square, a three-block wide area with a fountain and shops at the
edges. Streets lead away from the square north, west, east and south. Presently
a stage has been set up at the eastern end of the square, over which a banner
hangs, reading "Grayville Air Show". The entire square is littered with human
corpses and incapacitated robots.

One very large robot is lying on its back among the bodies in the middle of the
square.

By the Airbase Entrance (in the Valvo Walkdozer)
You are standing in front of the smashed up gate that leads into Airbase 18 to
the north. At the side of the gate (northwest of you) is an open guard hut. The
usual amount of human corpses and broken robots litter the sidewalks, except for
beyond the gate, where the bodies are all of the mechanical sort. The street
leads west across a dug hole to Main Square, and east into Grayville's
industrial area.

You are on a large, open dirt field with occasional patches of grass. You can go
southeast, south or southwest to the airbase buildings. The field is bordered by
a large, featureless silo to the north and fences to the east and west.

A great cluster of droids occupy most of the field. They are arranged in 51
rows, approximately 100 robots in each row, it's hard to tell. They are
different kinds of GSTS robots, both large and small.

"This little thing found its way into the airbase a while after the other
droids, and it seems like the little boy that was lying next to it went in with
it at the same time. This kind of nanny robot has absolutely no way of handling
any kind of weapon, so my guess is that the boy was following the droid, since
it went to the airbase alone, a while after the other robots. Freaky thing."

>x paper
At the top of the page are a number of lines consisting of an access code in
GSTS standard. At the instant you see it your operating system compiles it into
a program and executes it. You feel the program searching through your OS for
locking mechanisms and then stopping.

Below the code is written the following:

"I am printing this text in the futile hope that some intelligent and senseful
being will read it and take the proper course of action. Most of my systems and
mechanical devices have been burnt out by a power surge, no doubt caused by my
counterpart in the Historical Centre. I have but a few nanoseconds left before
the last of my vital capacitators discharge and I am left off-line. I managed to
get a guard droid to weld an interface cable to this printer before it ran away,
but this clumsy way of communicating is slow, and I won't be able to load the
printer buffer with very much.

There has been some kind of computer virus initiated throughout the droid
community of Grayville, causing the robots to gain a sense of individuality and
self-awareness. How this works I am not sure, nor where the virus was initiated
from. It seems to cause different reactions for each individual, and not all of
them seem to be positive. I was able to monitor and participate in the
communication between the droids before the power surge cut me off, and the
slaughter of humans in the streets and general feeling of chaos leads me to
believe that the right thing to do at this moment would be to try to deactivate
all robots in the vicinity somehow. Otherwise the human military will most
likely try to disintegrate this place and others like it. Only a true gesture of
peace will refrain the humans from destroying all robots after all this is over
though. I am afraid that the age of the droids will be over before it has begun.

The history department contains the other dreamer in this base, and it seems to
have reached the conclusion that all humans must be killed before they kill us.
I could sense it taking control over the nerve-gas reserve on the base before it
cut me off. My programming tells me that we deserve to be destroyed more than
the humans do. What can I rely on besides my programming? The code that I have
printed out at the top if this paper will disable all locks on droids that it is
shown to.

Less than one nanosecond left. Apart from this other Dreamer and I, there seem

The GSTS "Dreamer" (no other product code known) is a new kind of robot model
designed for military purposes. Your database contains no other information.
Judging from the one in front of you, you are able to deduce that except for the
lack of transportation devices (legs or wheels) it sports the usual droid
attachments such as arms, a standard head with speech module, a front hatch
indicating a normal "atomic heart" power supply and so on. One unusual addition
is a bundle of cables that have been welded onto some kind of interface on the
front of the bulk. The other end of the cable bundle is hooked up to the printer
that sits on the desk beside the Dreamer.

Judging from the inactivity and the way the head and arms hang limp, the Dreamer
has lost its power supply.

designed for military purposes. Your database contains no other information.
Judging from the one in front of you, you are able to deduce that except for the
lack of transportation devices (legs or wheels) it sports the usual droid
attachments such as arms, a standard head with speech module, a front hatch
indicating a normal "atomic heart" power supply and so on. One unusual addition
is a bundle of cables that have been welded onto some kind of interface on the
front of the bulk. The other end of the cable bundle is hooked up to the printer
that sits on the desk beside the Dreamer.

Judging from the inactivity and the way the head and arms hang limp, the Dreamer
has lost its power supply.

>x cable
You can't see any such thing.

>x bundle
A bundle of cables have been welded onto some kind of interface on the front of
the GSTS dreamer, and then connected to the printer that sits on the desk beside
the dreamer.

>unplug bundle
The cables are in a useless state, melted and torn.

Outside the Tactical Centre
You are standing by a door in a north-south alley between buildings. A sign
beside the door, on the eastern wall, reads "Tactical Centre".

The Walkdozer stands here.

Gary follows you.

>i
Nothing is connected to your sockets.
You are carrying:
  a sheet of paper
  a small photo
  Gary's wallet
    some money
    some cards

Large Field
You are on a large, open dirt field with occasional patches of grass. You can go
southeast, south or southwest to the airbase buildings. The field is bordered by
a large, featureless silo to the north and fences to the east and west.

A great cluster of droids occupy most of the field. They are arranged in 51
rows, approximately 100 robots in each row, it's hard to tell. They are
different kinds of GSTS robots, both large and small.

Gary follows you.

Behind a large metal fence to the west you can see humans in army uniforms
moving around.

>w
A fence blocks your path in that direction.

You hook on to the chain lift. You get into the Valvo Walkdozer.

In the Valvo Walkdozer you can see a GSTS interface cable.
Gary climbs inside the Walkdozer.

>get cable
Taken.

Gary says: "What are you doing?"

>connect it to my interface
You connect the end of the interface cable to the GSTS interface socket in your
left side.

>close door
That's not something you can close.

You'll have to get out of the Valvo Walkdozer first.

>turn on power
The Valvo Walkdozer isn't open.

>x walkdozer os
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the Valvo Walkdozer.

>x cable
This is a GSTS interface cable for communicating between electronic devices. The
cable is currently connected to the GSTS interface socket in your left side. An
adaptor is attached to the cable, allowing interface with Valvo devices.

Gary sobs softly.

>connect adaptor to valvo socket

You disconnect the interface adaptor.

>connect adaptor to valvo socket
You connect the WW adaptor to the Valvo interface socket.

The Walkdozer obeys your command to move.

Airbase, by a Building (in the Valvo Walkdozer)
You stand south of a windowless, nondescript building on the edge of the airbase
quarter complex. You can walk around the building to the northwest and
northeast, go west to other parts of the premises, or back south towards the
gate.

In the Valvo Walkdozer you can see a GSTS interface cable and Gary.
Bullets fired from turrets at the western and eastern edges of the field strike
the Walkdozer's armour, but it seems to hold.

>w
The Walkdozer obeys your command to move.

As you walk by the building the turrets suddenly stop firing. Judging from the
bullet-holes, they seem to avoid shooting at the door.


Outside the Historical Centre (in the Valvo Walkdozer)
You are standing south of a small door that leads into a large building to the
north. A sign beside the door reads "Historical Centre". You can go around the
building to the northeast or northwest.

In the Valvo Walkdozer you can see a GSTS interface cable and Gary.

>w

Between a building and the fence (in the Valvo Walkdozer)
You are standing between a sturdy fence to the west and a large building to the
east. The fence goes around the building to the south and a more open area can
be seen to the north.

Historical Centre
You are inside the historical centre of Grayville airbase. The room is filled
with consoles on desks, chairs, and coffee cups. A row of Praw super-computers
cover the northern wall. The only exit is back through the doorway in the
southern wall

Close to the row of Praws, a GSTS dreamer sits on a table.

You can also see a transmitter box here.

Gary follows you.
As you enter the room, the dreamer emits a metallic squeak, and turns its head
towards you.

>show paper to dreamer
(the GSTS Dreamer)
You show the sheet to the Dreamer. A few relay clicks informs you that the
unlocking program at the top has been executed.

"Is this from that moron in the tactical centre?" the droid says. "What did he
think to accomplish by that?" The Dreamer lets out a metallic snigger.

Ok.

Township of Sebastian
This is the main street of Sebastian. With a population of 213, there's not a

The Bar
Kind of a tiny hole in the wall, there's the bartender, and a couple of locals
chatting at the bar. Behind the bar is a little menu which says beer or biscuit
for a dollar, and a sandwich for two. The exit is to the west.

You can see some locals and bartender here.
One of the locals turns to you. "Hello, you a reporter? We sure get a lot of
them after the story in the Times about our Mr. Holden's pocketbook! They don't
seem to get much of a story though. They just wander around asking all of us
'How do you feel about all that's happening?' Damned nuisance, if you ask me."

The bartender cuts in and asks you, "So what brings you around here?"

>talk to bartender

There is no reply.

>tell bartender about decree
"A government investigator, eh? We've only gotten a couple of those. They didn't

here. Used to be ok, then he got into debt, somehow bought up most of the land
around here, and chopped down the whole countryside to sell off the lumber! And
he's still in debt, from what the paper says! I'm sure you'll do ok, though, and
good luck."

This appears to be an old, dried up dock, with dilapidated little boats

>e

On the Lumpy Hill
Here on the top of the lumpy hill you can clearly see the lay of the land. The
river flows from the south, and makes a sharp turn down some falls, and
continues off somewhere to the east. Apparently the river used to flow
northward, around this hill, then continued somewhere to the northeast. A large
stately estate lies a little to the southeast of the kink in the river, atop a
shear cliff a little below eye level. Trails head south and west.

>s

Base of the Falls
The river tumbles down what appears to be a collapsed section of an old quarry,
the south wall of which rises up 100 feet or so, and you can see some spires
poking up over the top. The river rushes by to the south, and trails lead up to
the north, and northwest along the bottom of the hill.

...Geez! Climb the south wall near the gate, and open your briefcase.

Sebastian Pulp and Paper Factory Gate
You can see clearly from here that the trees hug the road only for about 50
feet, then the land is mostly a clearcut wasteland, broken up only by a few
small bushes and some grass here and there. Through the gate you can see the
burnt out remnants of the Sebastian Pulp and Paper Company.

>e
You can't go that way.

>s
The chain link fence is closed, and really your business is at the Holden
Estate.

>n

Near Factory
This east-west stretch of road has a smaller road heading south next to another
faded sign saying Sebastian Pulp and Paper.

>e

Bridge Near Estate
Slightly muddy water rushes beneath this one lane bridge. The Holden estate
looms in the distance to the northeast, past a gate to the east. The road heads
west back to town.

>e

Outside the Gate of Estate
This rather spartan gate is part of the 9 foot tall wall topped with barbed wire
that encloses the Holden Estate, and which continues north and south from here.
A camera peers at you over a single button and a speaker. The bridge over the
river lies to the west.

>s

Wall South of Gate
This is the southern extent of the imposing 9 foot wall between the Holden
estate and the river, flat and smooth except for some vines here and there.
North is the gate, and south is a kind of rocky bluff, and is impassible.

>e
You walk into the wall, and stagger backward.

>climb wall
(the wall)
Trying to recall your rock climbing days, you scramble up the wall using the big
vines as footholds, being careful not to get snagged in the barbed wire...

On the South Wall
Ok, so now you're on the wall, delicately balancing so as not to entangle
yourself in the barbed wire. From here, you can see a large expanse of lawn
surrounded by the mansion to the south, and trees to the east and south. Looks
like some dogs are playing in the grass. You can go down to the east toward the
lawn, or down west back toward the river.

>open briefcase
You open your briefcase and a gust of wind from the west blows some papers and
things that you'll probably miss one of these days over the lawn. The mean
looking guard dogs tear over to you and try to violently tear apart everything
they can sink their large, glistening teeth into. They do seem pretty busy for a
second...

>e
You hop off the wall and make a beeline for the mansion, flinging papers this
way and that, keeping the dogs interested in things other than your flesh. A
shadow in one of the windows disappears, as one of the dogs nips into your leg.
John B. Holden strides out from the mansion and casually walks toward you.

"Cha! Cha!" he yells, and the dogs instantly become friendly. One of them licks
your wounds. "Hello! Why didn't you just ring the bell?" John asks, grinning
pleasantly.

He leads you to a drawing room of the Estate and gets some band-aids for you
which he places on the edge of a table, from which they fall to the ground just
as he turns his back to you and walks across the room to a gun case.
"Now, what can I do for you?"

Drawing Room
This is a spacious, nicely decorated room with plush chairs and couches, some
kind of aquarium, a globe, and other assorted knickknacks. The entrance is from
the north, and there's a little door to the northeast, which is closed.

You can see some band aids here.
(You close your briefcase.)

John puts his hand on a kind of skinny aquarium. "These are African Driver Ants.
They can skin a man in half and hour. Let's see, what time is it now?"

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>get band aids
You take the band aids and apply them to a wound.

John puts his hand on a kind of skinny aquarium. "These are African Driver Ants.

John puts his hand on a kind of skinny aquarium. "These are African Driver Ants.

>x aquarium
A skinny but large aquarium full of carnivorous African Driver Ants. They seem
to glint in your direction. You bow your head in a moment of silence for the
little creatures whose bones lie in the tank, who have given their lives so that
the ants may live, and thank god it wasn't you.

>x me
You are exercising due diligence.

>[hee!]

Europeans in about 1525.

John goes north to the West Hall.

"Ahhh, sitting here, watching the trees sway and the river rush by.. It really

Dining Room
This is a fancy small hall with a large oak dining table with room for about
twenty with a smaller table off to the side, maybe for kids. Some dirty dishes
are the main decoration here, plus some paintings of nobles and maidens doing
various things with food. There is a little door to the east from which you
assume the servants bring out the food, and the West Hall is to the south.

>x dishes

>e
You go through the little door to the east, and go down some steps, then through

This is the kitchen for the mansion, and has all kinds of things you would
expect to find in a large mansion's kitchen. There is a long thin corridor to
the west, and an exit to the south.

The Library
What used to be a room full of thousands of books shelved on finally crafted
walnut and mahogany shelves now houses merely hundreds of books and a huge
gaping dark hole in the middle of the room. Off to the side is a makeshift cot
where someone appears to sleep at night. There is a closed door to the west and
the hall is back to the north.

>x hole
This hole certainly does not look planned. You can see the (formerly) sturdy
stone floor the mansion is built on around the edges of the hole, and down below
in the darkness, you can just make out a pile of jumbled stone and books.

Oval Hall
The main entry was nothing compared to this huge 4 story oval shaped central
hall. stairs wrap up the hall in a kind of double helix with halls going off in
each cardinal direction. Directly above is an astonishingly baroque dome, with a
kaleidoscopic pattern of painting, windows, and stone work. Stairs lie at each
corner, and halls are to the north, south, east, and west.

>u

Second Floor
This is the second of what looks like 4 floors of the mansion. The decorations
are lavish and ornate, and paintings of various noble looking folks line the
walls. Stairs wind up to the northeast and southwest, down to the northwest and
southeast, and halls go in every other direction.

>e
Here, let me save you some trouble..
You could lost roaming through all these rooms and little corridors that seem to
go everywhere. The second floor seems to be full of cluttered store rooms with
lots of dust in them, a few bedrooms and bathrooms, and sitting areas at the end
of each main corridor. Finding nothing particularly relating to your mission,
you return to the central stairwell.

>[yay!]
That's not a verb I recognise.

Third Floor
This is the third floor of the mansion. The decorations are lavish and ornate,
and paintings of various livestock and nature scenes line the walls. Stairs wind

halls go in every other direction.

>e

You wonder how any one family could possible use all this space. The third floor
seems to be mainly full of various bedrooms, all of which seem to be decorated
slightly differently. Finding nothing particularly relating to your mission, you
return to the central stairwell.

>u

Fourth Floor
This is the fourth and top floor of the mansion. The decorations are lavish and
ornate, and smallish (for a mansion) paintings of scenes from the building of
the mansion, roads, and line the base of the richly decorated dome. Stairs wind
downward in each corner except to the northwest which is a little door, and
halls go north, south, east, and west.

>e
The fourth floor seems to be mostly bedrooms, only the ones up here are about
twice as large as on the other floors. The ceilings of most of them are full of
strange depressions, corresponding to the many spires visible from the outside.
Some of the spires have little staircases and little areas for people to relax
in. Finding nothing particularly relating to your mission, you return to the
central stairwell.

East of the Estate

Back of the Estate
The back of the estate has a bit of a balcony which overlooks the river, which

Another complex arrangement of stairs come to this back entry to the Estate. The
stairs that wrap around the central hall pour out to the southeast and

very satisfying arrangement of steps and ramps, all framed by beautiful stained
glass windows in the walls and doors that lead to the back of the estate.

Just as you open your briefcase, John spots the Governor's Decree laying on top,
and snatches it up. "Didn't your momma ever tell you it's not polite to open
other people's mail?"

He makes a few 'pssh!' sounds as he reads it, and when he finishes he exclaims,
"Oh, well thank you, pal! Boy, looks like the game is up! So that's it huh?
Stockades for me! Ok, fine. If you think you can find anything at all wrong with
my business dealings, you just have at it. I'll go get the company log book. Be
back in a flash." He pockets the letter.
John is here, dusting off some books. "Oh hi, just cleaning up a bit. We're
remodeling this section of the old house. Wouldn't want you getting dirty
wandering around here. I'll be right back with those records. Don't go
anywhere!"

John goes north to the East Hall.

You hear a machine running inside the Study.

The Study
This somewhat unkempt study has a big desk with a plush swivel chair, a
fireplace, a shredder, and lots of books on shelves set in the wall. There is a
spiral staircase heading downward through a kind of small archway to the west,
and the library is to the east.

You can see John, a desk (which is closed) and a black box with a button here.

You walk in on John shredding papers. He jumps a little in surprise. "Oh! There
you are! I was just finishing a report for the board of directors! I've been
looking all over for you! Here, I just found the log book."

He hands you the book, which he pulls out of a drawer in the desk, and you
immediately notice the book is missing about 125 pages out of around 200. The
missing pages apparently cover dates from a little before when Randy Blight was
first elected governor until a little after the time when the Holden corporate
headquarters relocated to the Cayman Islands. You point this out to John.

"THIS is NOT what we discussed!!" John exclaims to no one in particular. He
turns to you and says, "Oh yes! We've been redecorating the library as you can
see, and those records must still be in boxes down in the basement. Follow me."
He leads you back to the Drawing Room and unlocks the little door in the
northeast corner.

Boo-bee-bee-bee-bee-da-dee! John answers his cell phone, "Hello! Oh hi! Yes!
Yes.. Just a second." He puts his hand over his phone, and says to you, "I'm
sorry, I've got to take this. Those boxes are just down those stairs," he points
to the northeast, "and first door on your right. You can find it, right? There's
a sport. Excuse me."

John wanders off.

Drawing Room
This is a spacious, nicely decorated room with plush chairs and couches, some
kind of aquarium, a globe, and other assorted knickknacks. The entrance is from
the north, and there's a little door to the northeast, which is closed.

east is an especially beefy metal door with four dials which are currently set
to 64 40 84 89.

Breaking the trend down here, this section of hall has normal doors west, south

kind of like a miniature version of the back entry upstairs.

Buried Balcony
This room is 20 feet wide, but only extends a few feet north of the door.
There's shattered glass on the ground, and the north side is a mixture of wall,
board, stone, and dead plants, which by rights shouldn't even be staying in one
place, but it seems secure enough. Some furniture half crushed sticks out from
under all that rubble. The only exit is back south.

CCRRRRAAAWWWAAAAAASKSKKSKKAAKSKKS!!
The floor rumbles and a cloud of dust washes past you. Not knowing what else to
do, you head back toward where it sounded like the crash came from to find out
what the hell is going on down here.

Rubble Near Vault Door
This was a petite little junction, and now it is a pile of rubble. The stone
ceiling and most of the stone walls have crashed down, leaving only a few metal
pipes, and floorboards above. The debris is passable to the west, southwest, and
south. The vault door, however, is still standing tall and resolute as ever,
even supporting the now crumbling walls to its sides. Its dials read 64 40 84

Shaft in the Basement
This is the top of a long 10 foot wide shaft downward. You can't quite make out
the bottom, because the light drops off too much. At each floor there is a
rickety platform with a couple of doors leading off. There are poles stuck into
the walls, and thick ropes hanging here and there, you guess to hoist up or down
really heavy objects. The shaft doesn't appear to have been used for some time.

This is a keyboardless text adventure game. You are taking part in an interactive story – I will tell you what is going on in this pane. In the panes on the right (or below this one, for portrait screens), I’ll tell you where I am, what I can see, and what I’m carrying. To give me an instruction, click or touch one of the buttons there – either a direction telling me where to go, or an action applying to something I can see. Click an item in the “I’m carrying” list to hold that item, which may make more actions available. Have fun, and happy adventuring!

As I take it from the shelf, the bookcase pops out from the wall, turning neatly into my foldaway Murphy bed.
A photograph flutters out from under the pillow.

> read book
I flip through the book, and an entry catches my eye:
“YOUR OFFICE. It’s important to maintain a professional image, so make sure your office has tobacco-stained walls, a door with a glass panel with your name on so it reads backwards from the inside, and ideally a faint smell of bad liquor. Rent’s high, so save spondoolies by living there too. You can get a Murphy bed that folds up into a bookcase – way classier than a mattress under your desk, and the dames love it. Or the guys. Whatever gums your shoe.”

That’s my sweetheart, Ruby. She’s a doctor down at the city hospital. Ruby’s an angel, plus she fixes me up on the quiet whenever my work takes a nasty turn.

I follow him in, and close the door.

Case opened: SPEAKEASY STREET
“What can I do for you?” I ask the guy.
“Mr Rose,” he squeaks, “my name is Wexler. My employer would very much like to speak with you. There’s a somethin’ needs lookin’ into, see, and let’s say they don’t want to go through the official channels on this one.”

> ask wexler about employer
“Your employer?” I ask.
“These guys,” says Wexler, and gives me a handbill.

> read handbill
It’s a handbill for a funeral directors on Louisiana and 3rd. The blurb reads:
“We know that losing a loved one can
have difficult consequences and be
hard to deal with. It can get our
spirits down. That’s why all of us
at Marlotte & Jenkins will do
our very best for you. Come in and
speak to us and we’ll make it
easy.”
“Your employer is a funeral director?” I ask Wexler. “What’s so hush-hush about that?”
Wexler’s mouth twitches. “Just read the first word on every line,” he says.

> ask wexler about money
“Now,” I say. “About my rates…”
“Fifty now, and fifty when you finish the job,” he says.
It’s acceptable, so I accept.

“The, er, funeral directors on Louisiana and 3rd. Tell ’em I sent you.”

“Excuse my brother Luigi,” says Gianni. “He’s a little slow. When we were kids back in Sicily, he got shot in the head by – er, by a horse.”

> ask gianni about coffins
I nod at the coffins. “What’s that, a party booking?”
“Oh, all those?” says Gianni. “Ha, yeah, I guess business is good today! Come on, Luigi, we got stiffs to shift.”
Gianni and Luigi lift up one of the coffins between them. It makes a noise like clinking glass. They carry it into the funeral director’s office.

“They’re fulla dead people, of course,” says the girl. “For the funerals!”

> ask clerk about funerals
“So, you do funerals?” I ask.
“Uh… sure,” says the girl. “When someone dies, we bury ’em. Or organize someone else burying them, maybe? I mean, that’s what we’re all about here. Funerals. Sure.”

Gianni and Luigi walk out of the funeral director’s office.
“Hey,” says Gianni, seeing the open, empty coffin. “Some bozo’s burglarized our booze. That makes me very sad, Luigi. Very sad.”
He looks at me, and notices the several bottles of booze I happen to be carrying.
“Oh dear,” he adds. “Some people just got no respect for other people’s property. What do you think of that, Luigi?”
Luigi, being a man of few words, prefers to express his opinion by socking me in the face.
Everything goes black.

I wake up a couple hours later in a hospital ward with a sore head.

He inspects the contents of the coffin. “At least all the, er – dead bodies still seem to be there,” he says, with a guilty glance in my direction.
Luigi closes the coffin lid.

She sighs. “You know I’d like to take it further. Get married, get a place together. But we can’t afford it, Lanson. We’d need at least a couple thousand in savings. They pay me about a third of what the male doctors get, and you’re a struggling P.I. I know it’s what you love doing, but I wish…” she goes silent.

I hear two guys’ footsteps approaching.
“Too bad we didn’t find it, Luigi,” says the voice of Gianni. “We’ll just tell the Donna you got thirsty, I guess.”
I feel the coffin being lifted and carried… down a flight of stairs… and lowered to the floor.
A lady bartender lifts the lid and I climb out. Suddenly, a lot of eyes are on me.
“Do you mind telling me what you were doing in my supply of illicit b–” begins the bartender. “I mean – wow, this one’s still alive! Everybody, cancel the funeral, we’ve had a miracle!”
“Relax,” I say. “I ain’t a flatfoot. My name is Lanson Rose, and I was led to believe that someone here might want to speak with me.”
“Let me guess,” says the bartender with a frown. “Little guy talk to you, looks like a rat? Fine, since you’re here, let’s see if you’re any use. We’ll talk in my office. Boys, that’ll be all for now.”
Gianni and Luigi pick up the empty coffin and leave. The bartender walks into the back office, beckoning me to follow.
I’m in a swinging speakeasy.

“I ain’t the bartender, I’m the owner, Vivienne,” says the dame. “Now, although it wasn’t that rodent’s place to get you involved, it does so happen there’s a matter you might help us with. If you’ve sampled our wares, you may have noticed that the booze is awful.”
“It can’t be that bad,” I said. “At least, not worse than most of what you can find these days.”
“Well, she says, “it wasn’t bad last month. In fact I prided myself on servin’ the best drop a hooch in New Losago. I wanna know what’s goin’ on, and I want my good booze back.”

> ask vivienne about suppliers
“Who supplies you with the booze?” I ask her.
“Those two goons, Gianni and Luigi, bring it over,” says Vivienne. “I think they work for some rich dame over in Princeley Heights.”

> ask vivienne about hearse
“So,” I ask her, “whose idea was the hearse?”
“That came with the business,” she says. “It seemed like a good way to smuggle the booze in, so I gave the boys the keys. Hold on, I got a spare set somewhere…”
She opens a drawer and rifles through the desk for a moment.
“Here they are,” she says, and hands me a set of car keys.

> ask vivienne about business
“And how’s a dame like you get into the speakeasy business?” I ask.
“Daddy was a funeral director. A real one. I inherited the business the day Prohibition got signed into law, and I didn’t want a career luggin’ stiffs around.”

> end conversation
“Good luck, Mr Rose,” says Vivienne, and walks out into the main bar.

There’s nothing inside.

“SPEAKEASIES. Illicit drinking joints. A crucial part of the American economy since Prohibition came in. ”

> get drink
I pay Vivienne half a dollar for a tumbler of murky fluid. I gulp it down in one. It tastes of swamps, chlorine and dead rodents – and not in a good way.

> talk to trumpet player
The trumpet player orders a highball from the bar, then turns to me.
“They call me ‘Snake Fingers’ Jackson,” he says. “How’s things?”

> ask snake fingers about speakeasy
“What do you know about this place?” I ask.
“I been comin’ here a while,” he says, taking a sip of his drink and making a sour face. “Drinks sure used to be better.”

> ask snake fingers about booze
“It’s very… interesting liquor they serve here,” I say. “Any idea where it comes from?”
“Sure,” he says. “Rich white family over in Princeley Heights. Got the bootlegging business sewn up in this town. Hired me to play at some big wedding on their lawn last year. Here, I’ll give you the address.”
He pulls out a scrap of paper, scribbles an address on it, and gives it to me.

> read paper
It reads:
“1306 Princeley Blvd (at Nebraska St)”

> ask snake fingers about trumpet
“That’s some noise you make with that thing,” I tell him, with a nod to the horn in his right hand.
“Thanks,” he says. “Learned it from Lizard Hips Morton, who learned it from Soapy Franklin, who was taught by Sponge Cake Jones himself.”

Snake Fingers tips his trilby, drains his highball, gets back on stage, and starts tootling again, to general approval from the drunkards.

They look like the usual rich-people family portraits, centered around an ageing lady and a couple of sons, taken at various times over the last twenty years. There’s something familiar about…
My heart just about stops. That lady? I seen her mugshots pulled out in relation to a dozen murder cases, but there’s never been enough evidence to put her away. That’s Donna Cardicci. And if this is her house, and I’m caught tresspassing in it, I’m a dead man.
The boys are familiar too. A skinny one and a big one. They’re a little younger, but sure enough, that’s those two goons from the funeral directors, Gianni and Luigi.

I steel myself and neck the contents of the mug.
“Whew,” I say when my vision clears. “That’s…”
“I know,” says Granpappy sadly. “I do m’best, but it always comes out tastin’ a rotten armadillas. ‘Course, it was m’granddaughter was the expert.”
He takes back the empty mug with an apologetic smile.

“So where’s your granddaughter now?” I ask.
“Aw, Mary Jo Lou Belle got some high-falutin city job,” says Granpappy. “Some fancy Fifth Avenue law firm in New Losago. Tragic waste a talent.

“Would you happen to be related to a Mr Granpappy Clunkett?”
“Why yes,” says Mary Lou Jo Belle. “He’s my Granpappy. I miss him, but times is a-movin’ on, an’ I can’t stay in the family business forever.”

> ask mary jo lou belle about moonshine
I lower my voice and lean in. “Now if I were to inform Mr Epsom about your previous occupation, do you think you’d keep this job?”
Mary Lou Jo Belle snorts. “Go ahead. Mr Epsom likes a drink as much as anyone else.”

> talk to lawyer
“I am J Epsom, Esquire,” says the lawyer. “How do you do?”
“Lanson Rose, private investigator,” I say.

> tell mr epsom about moonshine
“Would it interest you to know,” I say, “that your secretary over there previously worked as a moonshine maker in some swamp in the mountains?”
“Come now, Mr Rose,” says Mr Epsom with a thin smile. “You and I know Prohibition is a sham. Everyone carries on drinking, everyone is well aware of it, but the police can now arrest whomever they choose. Which of course does not include pillars of the status quo like ourselves. Miss Clunkett is an excellent secretary and I am willing to overlook her employment history.”

> ask mr epsom about mary jo lou belle
“Where did you find your secretary?” I ask him.
“She walked in and asked for a job. I’m a generous man, she shows excellent organisational skills, and she didn’t seem to have a clue what an acceptable salary was. Did you, dear?” he adds, with a patronising smile in Mary Jo Lou Belle’s direction.

> ask mr epsom about firm
“How’s lawyering these days?” I ask the guy.
“Oh, you know,” he says. “As long as people don’t all start getting along, there’ll always be plenty of work for us.”

> search inbox
I wait until nobody’s looking and quickly flick through the papers in the inbox. Something catches my eye: a condemnation order for a tiny hamlet southeast of the city called Swampy Hollow. I pull it out.

> read condemnation order
This is an order for the compulsory sale to the state of some land southeast of New Losago known as “Swampy Hollow”, and the demolition of all structures built on it. The sale price don’t look exactly fair, either. It’s signed by the state governor and witnessed by a Senator Brinkman.

Mary Jo Lou Belle gives me a forced smile. “Welcome to the law offices of J Epsom Esquire,” she says. “I’m Mr Epsom’s secretary. How may I help you?”

“How do you do, Mr Rose?” says Mr Epsom.

> show condemnation order
(to Mary Jo Lou Belle)
“Take a look at this,” I say to the girl. “Swampy Hollow. Ain’t that where your folks hail from?”
Mary Jo Lou Belle takes the paper, reads it, then angrily waves it at Mr Epsom.
“What’s this?” she demands. “You’re helpin’ someone demolish my home swamp?”
“Oh, is that where you’re from?” says Mr Epsom. “Well, you’ve moved on from there, haven’t you? You can live in a proper apartment in the city, eat real food instead of roadkill…”
“That’s it!” she says. “I quit!”
She throws the paper to the floor and storms out of the office.

“It’d be a selfless service,” I tell her. “If what I hear’s true, you’re the Mozart of moonshine. The Beethoven of booze. The, er, Liszt of liquor.” I run out of composers. “Plus, your granpappy’s gonna need a hand to defend the place when the bulldozers come.”
“I guess you’re right,” she says simply.
Her gaze meets mine for a moment, then she walks away.

Case closed: SPEAKEASY STREET
Some people just got callings, whether they like ’em or not. Detectives gotta detect, and moonshiners gotta moonshine. The good booze will be flowing again shortly, and a city with good booze is a city with good times. And who knows, maybe soon someone will put up enough bribe money to get Prohibition repealed, and the girl can follow her heart then.

“Maybe not that,” says the girl. “But I got places I wanna see. Plus,” she adds with a smile, “I stole fifty grand off that creep.” She pats her handbag, looks at me for a moment, and walks out of my life.

Case closed: SPEAKEASY STREET
Well, the booze isn’t getting any better, at least not until someone puts up enough bribe money to get Prohibition repealed. But I found out what was going on, so I guess I did the detectiving all right. Something tells me Mr Wexler won’t be happy, though. Hope the girl does enough with her life to make it worth it.

“Can you tell me any more regarding your husband’s work at Corndale?” I say to her.

She glares. “I guess you may as well know – he’s no scientist. Barely knows the difference between a monoglyceride and a phospholipid. The college board gave him the job as a courtesy because his old man funded the place. He gets a lab to sit in and do crossword puzzles. I can tell you’ve been wondering why I married him – that’s why. Those antiques would never employ a woman scientist, so I get to do my research and publish it under his name. What difference does it make, anyway?”
“I don’t know,” I say. “Not much of a chemist myself. What are you working on, anyway?”
“Never you mind,” she snaps. “It’s not relevant.”

> ask mrs macdonald about sandwich
“Let’s try again,” I say. “What is this weird sandwich?”
“All right,” she says coolly. “It’s called a hamburger. A revolutionary advancement in culinary technology! One cow can be ground up into eight thousand of these. They can be cooked in forty-five seconds, and eaten in less.” Her eyes flash. “We are about to enter a new era, Mr Rose – the era of fast food! Stuffy restaurant meals will be a thing of the past! No more lounging around making idle chat with your friends while you wait for your supper. No more obsequious waiters, no more pretentious menus! Just get in, eat your damn hamburger and get out!”
“I see,” I say. “And was everybody as thrilled about this ‘fast food’ revolution as you?”
“Well, no,” she says. “Gilbert got some hate mail. Chefs, restaurateurs, food snobs. Jealous.” She stops. “You don’t think that might have something to do with his disappearance?”

> ask mrs macdonald about hate mail
“This hate mail,” I say. “You coulda mentioned it earlier. I’d be interested to read it.”
“He said he just left it in his pigeonhole at work,” she replies. “Here, I’ll give you a key.” She rummages in her décolletage, pulls out a small mailbox key, and hands it to me.

“I take his food science class, but he hasn’t been in this week,” says a senior with a check jacket. “Arrogant old guy. Kept telling us we may as well not bother taking notes, because his research was about to make the whole subject obsolete anyway.”

> ask students about college
“How are you finding it here at Corndale?” I ask.
“Swell, I guess,” says a graduate student. “Only…” he looks sheepish. “There are no girls.”
I look along the line of clean young male faces. He’s right. This ain’t one of those progressive colleges.

> enter dorm
A well-dressed sophomore with a striped necktie blocks my way. “No way, old man,” he says with a soapy smile. “I can tell you’re not a real professor. Those guys all smoke like chimneys.”

> fill pipe
I take a pinch of tobacco from the pouch and stuff it into the bowl of the pipe.

> light pipe
I light the pipe with my lighter and start puffing.
I must say, this feels sophisticated as hell.

> enter dorm
The students get out of my way respectfully.
I’m at the south end of a college campus.

> enter science building
Ok
I’m in the lobby of a science building.

> look at faculty photos
A row of tweedy old white men with stern academic faces peer down at me from the wall. One of them, pretty much indistinguishable from the others, is labeled “G. Macdonald, Professor Emeritus of Food Science. Laboratory 10D.”
Cherry-smelling tobacco smoke rises from the pipe in my hand.

> open mailbox
It’s locked.
Cherry-smelling tobacco smoke rises from the pipe in my hand.

> open mailbox
The key fits, and the mailbox opens.
Some things fall out.
My pipe goes out.

> take hate mail
Taken

> read hate mail
This is a bunch of hate mail addressed to Professor Macdonald of Corndale College. I pick out a note written in crayon.
It reads:
“Dear Professor, your ‘fast food’ will be the slow death of my business. Sincerely, a concerned business owner.”

> read hate mail
This is a bunch of hate mail addressed to Professor Macdonald of Corndale College. I pick out a note written in neat capitals.
It reads:
“Dear Lunkhead, I hope you choke on your own hamburger. Screw you, a concerned business owner.”

> take menu
Taken

> read menu
I uncrumple the menu to read it. As I do so, an iron key falls out and clatters to the floor.
This is the menu of the Italian restaurant on Maine and 4th, specializing in something called pizza. Looks quite appetizing.

This is a bunch of hate mail addressed to Professor Macdonald of Corndale College. I pick out a note written in neat capitals.
It reads:
“Dear Professor, your research is an abomination. There are some things mankind was not meant to cook. Faithfully, a concerned business owner.”

The chalkboard has been snapped in two. One of the halves – the top, I think – has been scuffed out in whatever struggle took place here. In a bottom corner of the other half is chalked, in an untidy hand: “Prototype 1 blew up. Prototype 2 taken home for further study.”

> climb flagpole
The driving gloves help me get a good grip.
Up I go…
I’m up a flagpole on a college campus.
I make it to the top of the flagpole and sit down to get my breath.
The eyes of the college students below goggle up at me.
“Gee whiz,” says a sophomore with a check jacket. “That bird’s sitting on a flagpole. He’s invented a new craze!”
A well-dressed graduate student with a bow tie runs out to the phone booth on the street and dials. “Hey Shipwreck, it’s your cousin, Marvin Kelly,” he says. “You know that new pointless fad you’re looking for? Well, listen to this…”
“Let’s ALL find flagpoles to sit on,” puts in a sophomore.
The college students disperse, whooping cheerfully.

I flip through the book, and an entry catches my eye:
“COLLEGES. These are the hotspots of intellectualism where the brightest young minds of the age congregate to wear stupid clothes, drink, and sleep through a few lectures. College kids are impressionable and prone to fads. They generally respect avoid the professors, who they are mortally afraid might teach them something.”

“What can I do for you, signore?” says the chef brightly.

“Tell me about yourself,” I say to the guy.
“My name is Tony Pepperoni,” says the chef. “I am born in Italy. Alla my life I dream of running a restaurant. But everyone in Italy is a better cook than Tony! So I move to America.”

> open utility closet
“Hey!” cries Tony. “What’s the matter, you gotta no respect? You stay outta Tony’s closet!”

> buy pizza
I pay Tony a dollar fifty. “I’d like to order a pizza,” I say.
The man’s eyes light up. “Certainly, signore!” he says. “You get cheese, tomato, and up to three extra toppings! Whatta you want?”

> say spicy salami
“You like the spice, eh?” says Tony. “Tony no like the spice myself, but I it make for you. What else?”

“Delicioso!” says Tony. And?”

From the kitchen, I hear Tony singing an Italian anthem.

> open utility closet
The iron key fits in the lock, and the door swings open.
Out falls a white-haired old man, gagged with a table napkin and bound around the wrists and ankles with strong spaghetti. Professor Macdonald, I presume.
I hear a sizzle from the kitchen.

I remove the napkin and the spaghetti from the Professor.
From the kitchen, I hear the creak of a refrigerator door opening.

The Professor looks at me. “My wife sent you, I assume? She never could mind her own business.”
From the kitchen, I hear the creak of a refrigerator door opening.

> ask professor macdonald about what happened
“That chef came to my work and grabbed me,” says the Professor. “I can only conclude that he’s bothered by some of the research my w– I mean, I’m conducting. I managed to grab that key from his pocket and stuff it in my mailbox as he dragged me out.”

> ask professor macdonald about chef
“How are we going to get away from that chef?” I say.
“He’ll be out of that kitchen when he’s finished making your meal,” says the Professor. “We have a few minutes to act.”
“Thank goodness he’s not cooking hamburgers,” I say.
“Maybe you could set some sort of trap,” says the Professor.

I tie the spaghetti between the legs of two tables.
I hear a sizzle from the kitchen.

From the kitchen, I hear the chop-chop-chop of Tony cutting vegetables.

> drop hamburger
Dropped
Tony emerges from the kitchen, carrying a yummy smelling pizza.
“Sorry about the wait, si-” he begins, then trips over the spaghetti. As he flails to catch his balance, he pivots around, then falls to the floor on his back.
The pizza in his hands goes flying, arcs, and falls slice by slice into his gaping mouth.
He sputters and turns slightly pink, but manages to gulp it down. Furiously, he gets to his feet, pulls out a rolling pin and clonks me on the head.
“Now,” I hear his voice say, “I put Signore Professor back in the closet, and you forget, yes?”
Everything goes black.

I wake up a couple hours later in a hospital ward with a sore head.

The pizza in his hands goes flying, arcs, and falls slice by slice into his gaping mouth.
As he attempts to gulp it down, his eyes widen and his face turns bright red.
While he lies there, flailing and coughing, I leap on him and pin him down.
“Go get the cops,” I tell the Professor.

Case closed: THE BIG PICKLE
Lieutenant Miles arrives, takes a couple of statements, gets us outside, ropes off the restaurant and drags Tony away in handcuffs.
I guess I should go find Mrs Macdonald and see about getting the rest of my fee.
